Product was developed\n\t2. Product was installed on client's computer\n\t3. Any changes made to the product post-installation were considered maintenance\n- This is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003etemporal definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Pre- or Post- installation determined whether an action was considered development or maintenance\n\t- This is very inconsistent, as the same action can be considered development or maintenance depending on timing alone\n\t- This is unrealistic for two other reasons:\n\t\t1. Long development timelines can mean that the client's requirements could change\n\t\t2. This definition also facilitates building everything from scratch with every product, which is uneconomical\n- A more modern approach is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eoperational definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Maintenance only occurs when a fault is fixed or the requirements change\n\t- This definition of maintenance is referred to as *modern maintenance* (or, just maintenance)\n\n### 1.3.2: The Importance of Postdelivery Maintenance\n- Only good products deserve maintenance, bad products are thrown out\n- Software is supposed to reflect a changing world, therefore adaptation is required for relevance\n- More and more of a product's total cost is in postdelivery maintenance (70-80% for many organizations)\n- Conversely to how new coding techniques should be considered in development, new (better) coding techniques should certainly be implemented in postdelivery as larger amounts of time/money can be saved","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.4":{"title":"1.4","content":"## Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects\n\n- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.5":{"title":"OOSE 1.5","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.6":{"title":"OOSE 1.6","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.7":{"title":"OOSE 1.7","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.8":{"title":"OOSE 1.8","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.9":{"title":"OOSE 1.9","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1":{"title":"Chapter 1","content":"## Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering\n\n-  [[OOSE 1.1|1.1: Historical Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.2|1.2: Economic Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.3|1.3: Maintenance Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.4|1.4: Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.5|1.5: Team Development Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.6|1.6: Why There Is No Planning Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.7|1.7: Why There Is No Testing Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.8|1.8: Why There Is No Documentation Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.9|1.9: The Object-Oriented Paradigm]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.10|1.10: Terminology]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.11|1.11: Ethical Issues]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Notes":{"title":"Object Oriented Software Engineering Notes","content":"\n- [[OOSE Chapter 1|Chapter 1:  Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/Software-Engineering":{"title":"Software Engineering","content":"\n- [OOSE Notes](notes/Spring%202023/Software%20Engineering/OOSE%20Notes.md)\n- [Software Engineering Exam 1 Study Guide](notes/Spring%202023/Software%20Engineering/Software%20Engineering%20Exam%201%20Study%20Guide.md)\n- [[]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T18:47:05.062732717Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/Software-Engineering-Exam-1-Study-Guide":{"title":"Exam 1 Study Guide","content":"\n1.
