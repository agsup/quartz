We often create evil for ourselves and others as imperfect humans. Evil also sometimes comes into the world through the spiritual war around us. God also sometimes brings down curses and judgement, which to the world looks like evil, and sometimes evil happens through pure accidents.\n\nWe should respond to evil with prayer and discernment, and even if we can't figure out the source, we can do our best to act in a Christian manner, which restricts Satan's power. When others are evil, we should react with grace, and when we are evil, we should take responsibility and work towards cutting the evil out.","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.423091592Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/10x":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Circuits-Report":{"title":"","content":"#Circuits \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Demo-Note":{"title":"","content":"**hi!**","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/OOP-Exam-4-Review":{"title":"","content":"#OOP \n[[OOP]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Study-Day-SE-Exam-1":{"title":"","content":"# Exam 1\n\n- Question 8: 3 maintenance = corrective, adaptive, and perfective","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/misc-notes":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023":{"title":"Spring 2023","content":"\n## Subject List:\n\n- [World Christian](notes/Spring%202023/World%20Christian.md)\n- [Wisdom and Prophets](notes/Spring%202023/Wisdom%20and%20Prophets.md)\n- [American Government](notes/Spring%202023/American%20Government.md)\n- [Software Engineering](notes/Spring%202023/Software%20Engineering.md)","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/American-Government":{"title":"American Government","content":"\n- [[American Symbology]]\n- [[Political Science]]\n\t- [[The Constitution]]\n\t- [[Laws]]\n- Branches\n    - [[Congress]]\n    - [[notes/Spring 2023/American Government/Executive]]\n    - \n- [Constitution Study Guide](notes/Spring%202023/American%20Government/Constitution%20Study%20Guide.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/American-Government/American-Symbology":{"title":"American Symbology","content":"\n*What we choose to represent us to the rest of the world*\n\n## Common Symbols\n- *E Pluribus Unum*\n\t- Out of many, one\n- Bald Eagle\n\t- They go wherever they want (represents freedom)\n\t\t- Personal note: can also represent hubris/pushiness/predatorial\n- Log Cabin\n\t- Made of wilderness\n\t- Built from nothing\n\t- Represents adaptability\n\t- Also represents pushing the frontier\n\t\t- *Sometimes at the cost of others*\n- Uncle Sam\n\t- Wants \u003cu\u003eyou\u003c/u\u003e to join the military\n\t- Represents American strength/military\n\t- Occasionally represents \"friendliness\" (as much as can come from the military)\n- Liberty Bell\n\t- Broken bell because we rang it too much after winning the Revolutionary War\n\t- We keep it as a symbol of our love for liberty\n- Statue of Liberty\n\t- Gift from France\n\t- Symbol of immigration\n\t- Inscription:\n\t\t- \u003e*Give me your tired, your poor, \u003cbr\u003eYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\u003cbr\u003eThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.* \n## Question: How do you govern the (massive) US population?\n- 1 Kings 3:8 (Cut the baby in half!)\n- Solomon's wish for wisdom was because he was overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of people to govern\n\t- This wish is granted, and it shows that God cares about government because of its ability to better the lives of humans\n- Congressional Fast Day Proclamation\n\t- Day for Congress and the American people to humble themselves and pray for repentance of sins\n## America's Founding Documents\n- ### Big Four:\n\t1.

Too stubborn.\n\t- A pocket veto occurs in the past 10 days of session, and this kills a bill nearly completely\n\t\t- States don't usually do this, it's mostly a federal thing\n\t- \n- Most bills die because they never make it to the agenda of the committee\n- Speaking of committees...\n    - Committees are where lots of the work gets done\n    - Committees have subcommittees\n        - Ex. Education committee has a K12 committee, a college committee, etc.\n    - Types:\n        - Joint committee\n        - Special/Select Committee\n        - Budget committee (3 types)\n            - Taxing\n            - Spending\n            - Balance (between taxing and spending)\n        - Standing\n            - Workhorses of Congress\n            - They do all of the research/sentiment analysis\n        - Conference (not the same as party conferences)\n        - Ways and Means Committee\n            - Revenue committee for the House\n            - Raises revenue for the Government\n            - First stop for ALL revenue bills\n            - \"Cadillac\" of Committees\n            - Creates exemptions, credits, and \u003cu\u003eloopholes\u003c/u\u003e \n            - Chair: Charlie Rangel (D-NY)\n                - He got caught \u003cu\u003e3 times\u003c/u\u003e not paying his taxes\n                - Kept his position because he helped New York!

Their press releases look like articles from \u003cu\u003eFox News!\u003c/u\u003e\n        - House Appropriations\n            - Spends money to fund government\n            - Appropriation: the legal authorization to expend governmental funds\n            -

Sets a rule for each bill about how debate will occur\n            - MUCH more powerful than even the Senate\n            - New chair is Tom Cole and he's a very, \u003cu\u003every\u003c/u\u003e old looking man\n# Extra Credit\n- State of the Union\n- ASI Speaker\n\n# The Twins\n- Specialization\n    - Members specialize based on prior education/occupation\n- Reciprocity\n    - Members of different specialties agree on a thing\n## Seniority\n\n- Unwritten, still powerful\n- Length of time in office = level of seniority\n- Senate Pro Tempore: Longest serving member of majority (traditionally)\n\n## Caucus\n\n- Gathering for a political purpose\n- Gathering of all members of the same party serving in the House/Senate\n- Republican majority in the house calls its caucus the Republican Conference\n\n### Congressional Caucuses\n\n- see textbook\n\n## Leadership Organization\n\n- Institutional Leadership vs. Political Leadership\n    -

Whips coordinate the party positions (keeps the dogs from running away)\n    - Counts votes\n    - Keeps votes in line\n- Twists arms\n\n## Party Loyalty\n\n- Mavericks: members who show less loyalty to their party and do not abide by informal rules\n    - Based individuals\n    - Actually care about stuff, and talk with other parties to try to get stuff done\n- Floor Lingo\n    - Calendar: list of bill scheduled for hearing/vote (same as committee agendas)\n    - Majority vs. Super-majority\n        - textbook\n- The Well\n\n## Filibusters\n\n- Only in the Senate\n- Unlimited debate\n- Holds progress captive (is cringe)\n- Rule 22 can break a filibuster, requires 60% vote to use\n- Cloture is a vote to end the debate\n- Can be used for good (occasionally)\n\n## Congressional Staff\n\n- Constituency Service is a major task of members' staff\n- Legislative functions include devising proposals, negotiating agreements, organizing hearings, and meeting with lobbyists/admins\n- Members' staff consider themselves advocates of their employers\n- New trend: staffers succeeding their bosses\n- 35,000 employees\n- Committee staff has declined in recent years\n- Minimum personal staff: 18 full time, 4 part time, no limit but budget in the Senate\n- Elected Staff:\n    - Clerk/Secretary\n    - Sergeants at Arms\n    - Chaplains\n\n## Executive/Legislative Tension\n\n- Even if they're from the same party, they don't always get along\n- Even if the President was previously in the legislature  they don't trust each other\n\n## Advise and Consent: Confirming and Ratifying\n\n- Senate confirms President's appointments\n- Senate ratifies all treaties\n\n## Oversight\n\n- Government Accountability Office (GAO)\n\n## Investigation\n\n- Unlimited power (uh oh)\n    - See McCarthyism\n- Congress can investigate whatever they want\n- Viewed super negatively\n- Sometimes turned towards the Executive, making tensions worse\n\n## Impeachment\n\n- House impeaches, Senate holds the trial\n- Johnson, Clinton and Trump were all impeached, but not convicted\n- Nixon saw that he would have been convicted, so resigned\n\n## War Powers Act\n\n- Congress has not used power to declare war since WWII\n- Criticism of the President's role in Vietnam led to the War Powers Act of 1973\n- President may only commit troops abroad for a period of 60 days (90 if including withdrawal)\n- Congress must approve a longer period\n- Nixon vetoed it, veto overruled\n- No matter what, Congress holds the purse.\n\n## Incumbency\n\n- But public disapproval!\n- There are still advantages because:\n    - Staff\n    - Franking (mail)\n    - Publicity/Media Coverage\n    - \"All publicity is good publicity\"\n    - Travel funds\n    - TL;DR, it's much, much cheaper running as an incumbent\n    - Voter apathy pays off for the incumbents\n    - Reapportionment is friendly to incumbents\n- Disadvantages:\n    - Publicly hated (but the hate isn't acted upon)\n    - Like, really, really hated (less than 1/10 of the population \u003cu\u003edoesn't hate Congress!\u003c/u\u003e)\n- Term Limits?\n    - They're not going to do it federally because it's too profitable!\n    - Some states were able to get it done\n\n## Reapportionment and Redistricting\n\n-  Decennial Census\n    - Every 10 years\n    - Only (intended) purpose of this census is purely population (everything else is bonus because `data data data...`)\n- Apportionment\n    - Distribution of voters into districts, dividing of representation by population\n    - Is judiciable (**this is crucial**)\n        - There have been court cases over these (very good!)\n        - Cannot gerrymander based on race (unfortunately party is still on the table)\n- Mal-apportionment is a bad split\n- Reapportionment\n    - The process of redistributing the populations among districts\n- Redistricting\n    - The process of drawing the lines within the States\n- States draw federal rep lines (not Senate because obviously)\n- Gerrymandering\n    - Named for Gov. Eldridge Gerry\n    - Lines drawn for partisan purposes (gross)\n    - Everyone does this, **all of the time.** (they're kinda gross)\n- Packing and Cracking\n    - Packing: putting as many of one party as possible in just one district\n    - Cracking: putting just few enough of one party as possible to that they aren't majority\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/American-Government/Constitution-Study-Guide":{"title":"Constitution Study Guide","content":"\n## Word Pairs\n\n- Power/Authority\n\t- Power = Strength, Authority = right\n- Issues/Politics\n\t- \n- Laswell's/Lenin's definition of politics\n\t- Laswell = authority, Lenin = power\n- Cost/Benefit\n\t- Not always monetary or immediate\n\t- How to value prevention?\n- Make/Enforce Rules of Society\n\t- These go together\n- Elitism/Egalitarianism\n\t- Americans are historically really good at believing in both of these, frustratingly\n\n## Three Questions to begin with\n\n1.

Veto/Veto Override\n\t\t\t- Judges appointed by Executive have to be Approved by Legislative\n\t\t\t- etc.\n\t1. Federalism\n\t\t- Calls for political authority to be distributed between a central government and the government of the states (Shared Power)\n\t\t- Federal and state government can act directly on the people\n\t\t- Each has exclusive powers\n\t\t- Political Authority is spread out to prevent power concentration\n\t1.

Detailed Design\n\t\t\t\t\t- Each module is broken down into more specific instruction/specifications\n\t\t\t- These processes result in design documents. which outline how the product works\n\t\t4. Implementation phase\n\t\t\t- The individual modules are coded and tested separately\n\t\t\t- The product is then tested as a whole (Integration)\n\t\t\t- Product is then tested by the client (Acceptance testing)\n\t\t\t- Phase is repeated until client is satisfied\n\t\t5. Postdelivery maintenance\n\t\t\t- After completion, changes are occasionally made to the product to keep it up-to-date and functional with new systems\n\t\t\t- Postdelivery Maintenance includes two sub-types:\n\t\t\t\t- Corrective maintenance\n\t\t\t\t\t- Removal of errors while keeping the specifications intact\n\t\t\t\t- Enhancement (software update)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Changes to the specifications/implementation\n\t\t\t\t\t- Two types of enhancement:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Perfective maintenance (performance benefits)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Adaptive maintenance (compatibility maintenance)\n\t\t6. Retirement\n\t\t\t- Removed from service, functionality of the product is no longer useful\n### 1.3.1: The Modern View Of Maintenance\n- 70's: Common knowledge was development before maintenance\n\t1. Product was developed\n\t2. Product was installed on client's computer\n\t3. Any changes made to the product post-installation were considered maintenance\n- This is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003etemporal definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Pre- or Post- installation determined whether an action was considered development or maintenance\n\t- This is very inconsistent, as the same action can be considered development or maintenance depending on timing alone\n\t- This is unrealistic for two other reasons:\n\t\t1. Long development timelines can mean that the client's requirements could change\n\t\t2. This definition also facilitates building everything from scratch with every product, which is uneconomical\n- A more modern approach is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eoperational definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Maintenance only occurs when a fault is fixed or the requirements change\n\t- This definition of maintenance is referred to as *modern maintenance* (or, just maintenance)\n\n### 1.3.2: The Importance of Postdelivery Maintenance\n- Only good products deserve maintenance, bad products are thrown out\n- Software is supposed to reflect a changing world, therefore adaptation is required for relevance\n- More and more of a product's total cost is in postdelivery maintenance (70-80% for many organizations)\n- Conversely to how new coding techniques should be considered in development, new (better) coding techniques should certainly be implemented in postdelivery as larger amounts of time/money can be saved","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.4":{"title":"1.4","content":"## Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects\n\n- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.5":{"title":"OOSE 1.5","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.6":{"title":"OOSE 1.6","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.7":{"title":"OOSE 1.7","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.8":{"title":"OOSE 1.8","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-1.9":{"title":"OOSE 1.9","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1":{"title":"Chapter 1","content":"## Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering\n\n-  [[OOSE 1.1|1.1: Historical Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.2|1.2: Economic Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.3|1.3: Maintenance Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.4|1.4: Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.5|1.5: Team Development Aspects]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.6|1.6: Why There Is No Planning Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.7|1.7: Why There Is No Testing Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.8|1.8: Why There Is No Documentation Phase]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.9|1.9: The Object-Oriented Paradigm]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.10|1.10: Terminology]]\n-  [[OOSE 1.11|1.11: Ethical Issues]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Notes":{"title":"Object Oriented Software Engineering Notes","content":"\n- [[OOSE Chapter 1|Chapter 1:  Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/Software-Engineering-Exam-1-Study-Guide":{"title":"Exam 1 Study Guide","content":"\n1.

Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response","content":"# Why Is All of This Happening? Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response\n## Who is Responsible for Evil?\n\n- *Rāh* in Hebrew is \"hardship\", \"trouble\", or \"disaster\"\n- God brings about both good and *rāh* (trouble)\n\n## Where does evil come from?\n\n- Materialists blame natural causes\n- Atheists say Christians can only blame God\n- Some Christians say evil doesn't exist\n- Some Christians are *overly* interested in evil\n\n## Complex Problem: 5 Answers\n\n### 1. Ourselves\n\n- We are tempted by our own desire (James 1:13-15)\n- We are the ones who sin (Joshua 7:20)\n- More examples: Uzzah, Nadau, Ananias, Mirian, and Barabbas\n\n### 2. Other Humans\n\n- Humans can be malicious towards other humans (Daniel 3:8-12)\n- Story of Stephen (Acts 7:54-58)\n\n### 3. Demon(s)\n\n- Satan has angels (Rev. 12:9, 12)\n- Satan himself \"prowls around\" (1 Peter 5:8)\n- The Bible speaks of cosmic powers and spiritual forces (Eph 6:12)\n- Paul warns about sacrificing to demons (1 Cor. 10:19-20)\n\n### 4. God\n\n- God can bring down curses (Amos 4:9)\n- God brings judgement (1 Cor. 11:19-30)\n\t- Examples: fire, serpents, other nations, etc.\n- Not necessarily a source of \"evil\" but of \"judgement\" that from a human perspective seems unfair\n\n### 5. Accidents\n\n- Abraham just died (Gen 25:8)\n- Storms come (Matt 8:23)\n- Disease/injury just happens (Mark 5:25)\n- Accidents just happen (Deut 19:5)\n\n## Responding to Evil\n\n- Discerning the source is difficult\n- Knowing that there are different sources keeps one grounded\n\t- Keeps blame from God\n\t- Restricts power to Satan\n\t- Encourages taking responsibility for one's sins\n\t- Encourages an attitude of grace","lastmodified":"2023-02-14T20:29:17.519091356Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/Top-15-College-Proverbs":{"title":"Top 15 College Proverbs","content":"\n## Topics\n\n### Sleep\n\n- Proverbs 20:13 and 3:21-24\n- Lesson and Meaning: If you have done well during the day, you'll sleep better.
