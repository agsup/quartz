Too stubborn.\n\t- A pocket veto occurs in the past 10 days of session, and this kills a bill nearly completely\n\t\t- States don't usually do this, it's mostly a federal thing\n\t- \n- Most bills die because they never make it to the agenda of the committee\n- Speaking of committees...\n    - Committees are where lots of the work gets done\n    - Committees have subcommittees\n        - Ex. Education committee has a K12 committee, a college committee, etc.\n    - Types:\n        - Joint committee\n        - Special/Select Committee\n        - Budget committee (3 types)\n            - Taxing\n            - Spending\n            - Balance (between taxing and spending)\n        - Standing\n            - Workhorses of Congress\n            - They do all of the research/sentiment analysis\n        - Conference (not the same as party conferences)\n        - Ways and Means Committee\n            - Revenue committee for the House\n            - Raises revenue for the Government\n            - First stop for ALL revenue bills\n            - \"Cadillac\" of Committees\n            - Creates exemptions, credits, and \u003cu\u003eloopholes\u003c/u\u003e \n            - Chair: Charlie Rangel (D-NY)\n                - He got caught \u003cu\u003e3 times\u003c/u\u003e not paying his taxes\n                - Kept his position because he helped New York! (cringe!)\n                - New chairman time\n            - Now we have Jason Smith\n            - Now the Committee is \u003cu\u003esuper frikkin Republican\u003c/u\u003e (gross, too partisan!!! yuck!)\n                - Their press releases look like articles from \u003cu\u003eFox News!\u003c/u\u003e\n        - House Appropriations\n            - Spends money to fund government\n            - Appropriation: the legal authorization to expend governmental funds\n            - 12 subcommittees\n            - Pork: Wasteful spending\n            - Always behind...\n        - House Rules\n            - The most powerful committee\n            - Bills must go through this committee to go to the House\n            - Sets a rule for each bill about how debate will occur\n            - MUCH more powerful than even the Senate\n            - New chair is Tom Cole and he's a very, \u003cu\u003every\u003c/u\u003e old looking man\n\n# The Twins\n- Specialization\n    - Members specialize based on prior education/occupation\n- Reciprocity\n    - Members of different specialties agree on a thing\n\n## Seniority\n\n- Unwritten, still powerful\n- Length of time in office = level of seniority\n- Senate Pro Tempore: Longest serving member of majority (traditionally)\n\n## Caucus\n\n- Gathering for a political purpose\n- Gathering of all members of the same party serving in the House/Senate\n- Republican majority in the house calls its caucus the Republican Conference\n\n### Congressional Caucuses\n\n- see textbook\n\n## Leadership Organization\n\n- Institutional Leadership vs. Political Leadership\n    - see textbook\n\n## Majority and Minority Leadership\n\n- Steve Scalise is the Majority House Leader\n- Hakeem Jeffries (young boi) is the Minority House Leader\n- Chuck Schumer is the Majority Senate Leader\n- Mitch McConnell is the Minority Senate Leader\n- Whips\n    - Whips coordinate the party positions (keeps the dogs from running away)\n    - Counts votes\n    - Keeps votes in line\n- Twists arms\n\n## Party Loyalty\n\n- Mavericks: members who show less loyalty to their party and do not abide by informal rules\n    - Based individuals\n    - Actually care about stuff, and talk with other parties to try to get stuff done\n- Floor Lingo\n    - Calendar: list of bill scheduled for hearing/vote (same as committee agendas)\n    - Majority vs. Super-majority\n        - textbook\n- The Well\n\n## Filibusters\n\n- Only in the Senate\n- Unlimited debate\n- Holds progress captive (is cringe)\n- Rule 22 can break a filibuster, requires 60% vote to use\n- Cloture is a vote to end the debate\n- Can be used for good (occasionally)\n\n## Congressional Staff\n\n- Constituency Service is a major task of members' staff\n- Legislative functions include devising proposals, negotiating agreements, organizing hearings, and meeting with lobbyists/admins\n- Members' staff consider themselves advocates of their employers\n- New trend: staffers succeeding their bosses\n- 35,000 employees\n- Committee staff has declined in recent years\n- Minimum personal staff: 18 full time, 4 part time, no limit but budget in the Senate\n- Elected Staff:\n    - Clerk/Secretary\n    - Sergeants at Arms\n    - Chaplains\n\n## Executive/Legislative Tension\n\n- Even if they're from the same party, they don't always get along\n- Even if the President was previously in the legislature  they don't trust each other\n\n## Advise and Consent: Confirming and Ratifying\n\n- Senate confirms President's appointments\n- Senate ratifies all treaties\n\n## Oversight\n\n- Government Accountability Office (GAO)\n\n## Investigation\n\n- Unlimited power (uh oh)\n    - See McCarthyism\n- Congress can investigate whatever they want\n- Viewed super negatively\n- Sometimes turned towards the Executive, making tensions worse\n\n## Impeachment\n\n- House impeaches, Senate holds the trial\n- Johnson, Clinton and Trump were all impeached, but not convicted\n- Nixon saw that he would have been convicted, so resigned\n\n## War Powers Act\n\n- Congress has not used power to declare war since WWII\n- Criticism of the President's role in Vietnam led to the War Powers Act of 1973\n- President may only commit troops abroad for a period of 60 days (90 if including withdrawal)\n- Congress must approve a longer period\n- Nixon vetoed it, veto overruled\n- No matter what, Congress holds the purse.\n\n## Incumbency\n\n- But public disapproval!\n- There are still advantages because:\n    - Staff\n    - Franking (mail)\n    - Publicity/Media Coverage\n    - \"All publicity is good publicity\"\n    - Travel funds\n    - TL;DR, it's much, much cheaper running as an incumbent\n    - Voter apathy pays off for the incumbents\n    - Reapportionment is friendly to incumbents\n- Disadvantages:\n    - Publicly hated (but the hate isn't acted upon)\n    - Like, really, really hated (less than 1/10 of the population \u003cu\u003edoesn't hate Congress!\u003c/u\u003e)\n- Term Limits?\n    - They're not going to do it federally because it's too profitable!\n    - Some states were able to get it done\n\n## Reapportionment and Redistricting\n\n-  Decennial Census\n    - Every 10 years\n    - Only (intended) purpose of this census is purely population (everything else is bonus because `data data data...`)\n- Apportionment\n    - Distribution of voters into districts, dividing of representation by population\n    - Is judiciable (**this is crucial**)\n        - There have been court cases over these (very good!)\n        - Cannot gerrymander based on race (unfortunately party is still on the table)\n- Mal-apportionment is a bad split\n- Reapportionment\n    - The process of redistributing the populations among districts\n- Redistricting\n    - The process of drawing the lines within the States\n- States draw federal rep lines (not Senate because obviously)\n- Gerrymandering\n    - Named for Gov. Eldridge Gerry\n    - Lines drawn for partisan purposes (gross)\n    - Everyone does this, **all of the time.** (they're kinda gross)\n- Packing and Cracking\n    - Packing: putting as many of one party as possible in just one district\n    - Cracking: putting just few enough of one party as possible to that they aren't majority\n- ","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/American-Government/Constitution-Study-Guide":{"title":"Constitution Study Guide","content":"\n## Word Pairs\n\n- Power/Authority\n\t- Power = Strength, Authority = right\n- Issues/Politics\n\t- \n- Laswell's/Lenin's definition of politics\n\t- Laswell = authority, Lenin = power\n- Cost/Benefit\n\t- Not always monetary or immediate\n\t- How to value prevention?\n- Make/Enforce Rules of Society\n\t- These go together\n- Elitism/Egalitarianism\n\t- Americans are historically really good at believing in both of these, frustratingly\n\n## Three Questions to begin with\n\n1. The Nature of Man\n\t- Men are not inherently good, so power must be checked using a government\n2. Confederacy or Federal\n\t- Federal is country-level, confederacy is loosely assembled group\n3. Democracy or Republic\n\t- Democracy = short, bloody; Republic = stable\n\n## Three Models - How do Governments Relate?\n\n- Confederation\n\t- Like a club, loosely tied together\n- Federal System\n\t- Like marriage, a union is made\n- Unitary Nation State\n\t- Like a parent-child relationship, one is beholden to another\n\n## Democracy\n\n- Ancient Greek Influence:\n\t- Monarchy/Oligarchy/Democracy\n\t\t- Tyranny (Despots)\n\t- Demos-kratos (the people rule)\n- Democracy/Republic\n- Direct Democracy/Representative (Indirect) Democracy\n- Democratic/Republican Parties\n\n## Republic\n\n- Form of gov in which representatives elected by the people make and enforce laws and policies\n- We are guaranteed this kind of government\n- Representation with the consent of the sovereign governed\n\n## Key Documents\n\n- These need to be known \u003cu\u003ein order\u003c/u\u003e\n\t1.

Veto/Veto Override\n\t\t\t- Judges appointed by Executive have to be Approved by Legislative\n\t\t\t- etc.\n\t1. Federalism\n\t\t- Calls for political authority to be distributed between a central government and the government of the states (Shared Power)\n\t\t- Federal and state government can act directly on the people\n\t\t- Each has exclusive powers\n\t\t- Political Authority is spread out to prevent power concentration\n\t1. Judicial Review\n\t2. Limited Government with a Living Constitution\n\n- When there is too much power in one place, we split it\n\n## Cases in Chronological Order\n\n- Marbury v.

Postdelivery maintenance\n\t\t\t- After completion, changes are occasionally made to the product to keep it up-to-date and functional with new systems\n\t\t\t- Postdelivery Maintenance includes two sub-types:\n\t\t\t\t- Corrective maintenance\n\t\t\t\t\t- Removal of errors while keeping the specifications intact\n\t\t\t\t- Enhancement (software update)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Changes to the specifications/implementation\n\t\t\t\t\t- Two types of enhancement:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Perfective maintenance (performance benefits)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Adaptive maintenance (compatibility maintenance)\n\t\t6. Retirement\n\t\t\t- Removed from service, functionality of the product is no longer useful\n### 1.3.1: The Modern View Of Maintenance\n- 70's: Common knowledge was development before maintenance\n\t1. Product was developed\n\t2. Product was installed on client's computer\n\t3. Any changes made to the product post-installation were considered maintenance\n- This is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003etemporal definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Pre- or Post- installation determined whether an action was considered development or maintenance\n\t- This is very inconsistent, as the same action can be considered development or maintenance depending on timing alone\n\t- This is unrealistic for two other reasons:\n\t\t1. Long development timelines can mean that the client's requirements could change\n\t\t2. This definition also facilitates building everything from scratch with every product, which is uneconomical\n- A more modern approach is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eoperational definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Maintenance only occurs when a fault is fixed or the requirements change\n\t- This definition of maintenance is referred to as *modern maintenance* (or, just maintenance)\n\n### 1.3.2: The Importance of Postdelivery Maintenance\n- Only good products deserve maintenance, bad products are thrown out\n- Software is supposed to reflect a changing world, therefore adaptation is required for relevance\n- More and more of a product's total cost is in postdelivery maintenance (70-80% for many organizations)\n- Conversely to how new coding techniques should be considered in development, new (better) coding techniques should certainly be implemented in postdelivery as larger amounts of time/money can be saved","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.4":{"title":"1.4","content":"## Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects\n\n- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.5":{"title":"OOSE 1.5","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.6":{"title":"OOSE 1.6","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.7":{"title":"OOSE 1.7","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.8":{"title":"OOSE 1.8","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-1/OOSE-1.9":{"title":"OOSE 1.9","content":"- *content*","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-7/Abstract-Data-Types":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/OOSE-Chapter-7/Cohesion":{"title":"","content":"## Cohesion\n\n### Myers' 7 levels of Cohesion (adapted by Schach)\n\nFrom bad to good:\n\n1.

Explain the connection between functional modeling and use case scenarios.\n\t- A Use case scenario is a specific instantiation of a use case, Functional modeling presents the scenarios of all use cases\n5. **Explain each of the following and give a brief example (i.e. draw and label a small example):**\n\t- ERD (easy rectangle diamond)\n\t- Statechart (lollipop, flow)\n\t- CRC Cards (class-responsibility-collaboration)\n\t- Communication diagram \n\t- Sequence diagram\n\n## From notes on Wiegers, chapter 11\n\n6. **Explain each of the following and give a brief example (i.e. draw and label a small example):**\n\t- DFD (circles for methods, rectangles for actors, arrows for data)\n\t- STD (Rectangles for states, arrows for actions)\n\t- Dialog map\n\t- Class diagram\n\t- Decision tree\n\n**Three of the 10 diagrams will be on the test**\n\n- Know these:\n\t- What does it do?\n\t- What are the symbols?\n\t- Draw the diagram\n\nExample for ERD:\n\n- It models long-lived data (ex. Database)\n- Symbols are rectangle for class ,diamond for relationship, line for connection, tri-branch for \"many-to\" relation (\"Person\" can have multiple \"jobs\", for example)\n- Diagram using these symbols\n\nNotes:\n- 5b and 6b are the **same thing**\n- Class Diagram and ERD do the same thing (Long-Lived Data, but in different ways)\n- Communication vs. DFD\n\n| Comm                                | DFD                                    |\n| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Models one instance of one use case | Models data flow through entire system, disregarding sequence, uses hierarchy to facilitate top-down design | \n| Different Symbols                   | Different Symbols                      |\n\n\n## From MMM chapters 4, 5, 9\n\n7. **What is conceptual integrity? Why is it so important? How is it achieved?** **(very likely on the test)**\n\t- Conceptual integrity is the maintaining of the original design and architecture when you're adding features. It is important in order to maintain ease of use, maintainability, and construction. Achieved by having a small team of architects (or ideally one).\n8. What is the second system effect? Why does it happen? How can it be avoided?\n\t- The second system effect is where a system designer, after making a successful first system, tries to add too many extra features to the second system, usually leading to failure. It happens due to inflated confidence. It can be avoided by self-discipline, being mindful, and assigning value to functions\n9. How do program space and “size control” affect time and complexity in programming?\n\t- More functionality makes it more complex, and more functionality also means more space, with speed being constant\n\t- Time/Space/Complexity, improving one hurts the other two\n\n## From Schach, chapter 8\n\n10. List and define the two types of reuse.\n\t- Opportunistic Reuse - reuse of a component previously designed for a previous project \n\t- Deliberate Reuse - Specifically designing components to be reused\n11. **What are the major impediments to software reuse?**\n\t- NIH (Not invented here) syndrome  \n\t- Fear that component will introduce faults  \n\t- Storing the reusable components  \n\t- Reuse can be expensive  \n\t- Legal Issues  \n\t- Lack of Source Code\n12. Explain why reuse saves more on maintenance than on development.\n\t- Reusable components are well tested and documented which simplifies maintenance, but development is the same because the component still needs to be integrated\n13. Explain the difference between a framework, a library, and a design pattern.\n\t- Framework - a set of cooperating classes that make a reusable design for a specific class of software  \n\t- Library - a set of related reusable routines  \n\t- Design Pattern - a set of interacting classes which must be customized to create a specific design\n14. Give the author’s definition of a “portable” system.\n\t- A product is portable if it is significantly less expensive to adapt it to run on a new computer than to write it from scratch\n15. Why is portability so important for software systems?\n\t- Saves money on development of the adaptation  \n\t- Software has a longer life cycle than hardware, so software will have to be ported an average of 4 times\n\n## From notes on Bass, chapters 1 and 2\n\n16. **Define software architecture. **\n\t- The Software Architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them\n\t- structures system software elements visible properties relationships\n1. Give three reasons why software architecture is important.\n\t- It allows for communication among the stakeholders\n\t- It manifests the earliest design decisions and it defines the constraints  \n\t- It is a transferable abstraction of a system\n2. Briefly describe each of the following types of structures: module, component \u0026 connector, allocation.\n\t- Module Structure - units of implementation; code based  \n\t- Component \u0026 Connector Structures - run-time components and connectors which allow communication among the components  \n\t- Allocation Structures - answer questions about assignments, deployments, and implementation\n3. Describe the parts of the “four plus 1” standard for architecture.\n\t- Logical - module class view  \n\t- Process - component and connector view of concurrency and functionality distribution  \n\t- Development - Allocation view mapping software to development environment  \n\t- Physical - Allocation view mapping processes onto processors and communication nodes  \n\t- +1 - Check all of them against the use cases\n\n## From notes on Tsui, chapter 7\n\n20. Describe the relationship between the functional and non-functional requirements, as related to architecture and design.\n\t- Architecture is the high-level of the system and driven by the non-functional requirements\n\t- Design is much finer detailed, and is driven by the architecture plus the functional requirements\n21. List five examples of architecture patterns.\n\t- Pipes \u0026 Filters  \n\t- Layered  \n\t- Event-Driven  \n\t- Client-Server  \n\t- Three Tier\n\n## From Schach, chapter 7\n\n23. Give several reasons why good modular design is important.\n\t- Reduces cost of maintenance  \n\t- Makes it easier to read and understand  \n\t- Easier to Debug  \n\t- Easier to Extend/Add Features\n24. **Define cohesion.**\n\t- Strength within a module - how well the code belongs together\n25. **List (in order) and briefly describe seven levels of cohesion.**\n\t1. Informational - Operations on the same data  \n\t2. Functional - one operation  \n\t3. Communicational - multiple operations by sequence on the same data  \n\t4. Procedural - related by algorithm  \n\t5. Temporal - time relation  \n\t6. Logical - multiple operations selected by the flag variable  \n\t7. Coincidental - unrelated\n26. **Define coupling.**\n\t- Bond between two modules\n27. **List (in order) and briefly describe five levels of coupling**\n\t1. Data - simple localized data passed  \n\t2. Stamp - pass structure but only use a portion of it  \n\t3. Control - pass flags  \n\t4. Common - global data  \n\t5. Content - reference memory\n28. Briefly describe the steps in the evolution from modules to objects.\n\t- Modules \n\t- Good modules (coupling/cohesion)\n\t- Data encapsulated modules\n\t- ADTs\n\t- Info hiding (public/private sections)\n\t- Object (inheritance)\n29. Explain the concept and benefits of polymorphism, along with any other important closely related concepts.\n\t- Use of a base class that is inherited to make multiple versions of a function, called with dynamic binding\n\n## From Schach, chapter 12\n\n30. Explain what is involved in completing the class diagrams.\n\t- Determine the format of attributes, and then assign methods to the relevant classes.\n31. Explain what is involved in performing the detailed design.\n\t- Data structures are chosen, and specific algorithms are selected\n32. Explain cyclomatic complexity and fan-in/out and compare their effectiveness.\n\t- Cyclomatic complexity - number of binary decisions + 1\n\t- Fan-in - number of flows into a class plus global data accessed  \n\t- Fan-out - number of flows out of a class plus number of data structures updated by the class\n\t- They are all equally effective\n\n## From McConnell, chapter 5\n\n33. **What is the Primary Technical Imperative? Why is it so important?**\n\t- It is to manage complexity. Complexity is a major reason as to why projects fail\n35. Define abstraction and encapsulation and explain how they are related.\n\t- Abstraction - engagement while safely ignoring some details  \n\t- Encapsulation - Forbidding Details\n\t- Abstraction allows high level, encapsulation requires high level\n36. Give some reasons as to why information hiding is important.\n\t- Decreases Complexity  \n\t- Increases Modularity  \n\t- Useful at all levels\n\n## From McConnell, chapter 6\n\n37. Define ADT and class and explain how they are related.\n\t- ADT - Abstract Data Type, collection of data and operations that work on that data\n\t- Class - collection of routines and data that share responsibility\n38. Explain the concept of class inheritance and explain why it is important.\n\t- The purpose of class inheritance is to create simpler code by defining a base class that specifies common elements of two or more derived classes.  \n\t- It's important because it helps us to avoid the need to repeat code and data in multiple locations.\n39. What are the pros and the cons of using class inheritance?\n\t- Pros - Avoids repeating code and data in multiple locations (reuse code without rewriting it)\n\t- Cons - Increases Complexity\n\t- **Reduces redundant code, increases complexity**\n40. What are two things to avoid, related to using inheritance? Why?\n\t- Deep Inheritance, because it is easy to lose track of.\n\t- Multiple Inheritance, because it can be dangerous to your system.\n\t- TL;DR: **Multiple, Deep, Complexity**","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Software-Engineering/Sprint-Execution":{"title":"","content":"## Overview\n\n- Sprint execution is like a

Salvation *through* judgement (9:7, 11-15)\n\n## New Testament Quotations of Amos\n\n- Stephen's speech: Israel rejects God and his prophets\n- James' speech: Gentile Christians are fulfilled\n\n## God of the Nations\n\n- Discusses 8 nations  (1-2)\n\t1. Damascus\n\t2. Philistia\n\t3. Tyre\n\t4. Edom\n\t5. Ammon\n\t6. Moab\n\t7. Judah\n\t8. Israel\n- Amos talks about how they will all be destroyed by God for their sins\n\n## Bethel and Gilgal\n\n- Wives of the Israelites called \"Cows of Bashan\"\n\t- Pampered and prized\n\t- They oppress the poor through indifference/demanding more wealth\n- Prophecy of the Assyrian exile with fishhooks\n- Note: Inaction is oppression.\n- Amos mocks the mocker\n\t- Their worship is sin (should be in Judah, not Bethel/Gilgal)\n\t- Their sacrifice = ineffective\n\n## God's Last Resort (Ch. 4)\n\n- Discipline of various kinds:\n\t- Famine\n\t- Drought\n\t- Pestilence\n\t- War\n\t- Fire\n- \"Prepare to meet your God\"\n\n## Do Not Seek The Altars (Ch. 5)\n\n- \"The altar\" (literal and metaphorical) alone will not save you\n\t- Church and chapel are examples of metaphorical altars\n- Seek Social Justice: Right your Wrongs\n\n## Amos' Visions (Ch. 7-8)\n\n- Locusts\n\t- LORD formed locusts that ate everything\n\t- Amos intervenes, and the LORD relents\n- Fire Shower\n\t- Fire was

2](#God%20of%20the%20Nations)\n- Worst kind of deceiver is the one who deceives their own\n- Because of this...\n\t- Famine of the Prophetic Word\n\t\t- God will withhold prophets from Israel during/preceding the Assyrian exile\n\t- No escape from the Day of the Lord\n\t- God points out that he has many \"exodus people\"\n\t\t- Many of the other nations have been saved in the same way as Israel\n\t- Being one of God's \"exodus peoples\" will not prevent judgement\n\n## Bonus Chapter (Ch. 9)\n\n- Good news\n- Israel will be rebuilt\n\t- Independence\n\t- Davidic King\n\t\t- Unbeknownst to Amos, this is a reference to Jesus\n\t- Abundant Produce\n\t- Repossession of the

You decide to make your own video explaining how OT prophets also had a message for their own audiences in their own day. Write a brief script for your video. Be sure to include the multiple purposes of OT prophets/prophecy. Also compare and contrast the specific purposes of Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah in their own day. Finally, tell your audience which of these three prophets you want to be more like and why. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. Who were prophets, how did they become prophets, and what did they do/say?\n2. What was going on economically, politically, and religiously in the 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century that called for Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah to prophesy? \n3. What did Amos have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n4. What did Hosea have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n5. What did Isaiah have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n6. What are the differences between Amos \u0026 Hosea? \n7. Which would you like to be more like and why? \n\n**My Answer: The prophets of the Old Testament became prophets in various different ways. Amos, for example, was a shepherd from the Southern nation of Judah, but after receiving a vision specifically targeted towards the Northern nation of Israel, he decided to become a prophet. Hosea received a direct, vocal request from God to marry a prostitute and continually retrieve her in her infidelity. This was meant to be a direct metaphor for Israel's disobedience and God's loyalty to his people. Isaiah was likely born of a royal family, and was called by God to prophesy, despite his lack of schooling in prophecy. All three of these prophets had very important messages for their day, and I don't understand why people think that they're message is more important today than it was back then. This is such an inane take that I don't even know where to start debunking it. Most of their prophecies directly referenced and discussed issues of Israel's impending demise, it can't get any more clear that these prophets were not just predicting the distant future. Amos directly stated that the land would be consumed and destroyed by using descriptions of fire and locusts. Hosea illustrated Israel's behavior by comparing it to the prostitute that God asked him to marry. Isaiah directly told the powers of the land that alliances will bring them nowhere. If I had to pick one of these prophets to try and emulate today, I would like to be like Amos as he was an effective speaker who traveled to people who he knew needed his message.**\n\n## Q2: Justice \u0026 Mercy:\n\n##### Your church is divided on the issue of whether the God of the OT is a just God or a merciful God. Describe to them how God demonstrated justice against the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. Then, describe how God demonstrated mercy toward the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. End with a couple of suggestions on how human can demonstrate both God's justice AND mercy to their enemies today. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Jonah? \n2. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Nahum? \n3. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Obadiah? \n4. Why it is important for God to be both just and merciful? How does he do it? \n5. Why is it important for us to be both just and merciful? How do we do it? \n\n**My Answer: I think that as a church we shouldn't be asking about whether God is merciful or just. The Bible makes it excruciatingly clear that God is both. In Jonah God's mercy is on full display as he spares Nineveh. However, in Nahum God shows his justice by ending Nineveh after they waste their second chance. In addition, in Obadiah, God's justice and mercy are both shown through a warning to Edom. God shows that he will punish them if they don't change, but will also give them a chance to change before he punishes. It is very important for God to be both just and merciful because God is love. A loving God helps his subjects to change in ways that benefit them and those around them, and this can be either through just punishment or through merciful admonishment. We as Christians need to be the same towards others, but we need to act as peers, not as \"rulers\" over \"subjects\". God is merciful and just through his correction towards people. To be just and merciful towards others we must also correct people, but in a loving way as God does.**\n\n## Q3: The Messiah and Day of the Lord: \n\n##### Pretend a modern day evangelist gets on TV and says the world is going to end in 2030 based on his understanding of \"The Day of the Lord\" and \"The Coming of the Messiah\" in the OT prophets. You have a chance to write a brief response that will be read by the same audience. Explain how \"the Day of the Lord\" was understood by Israel prior to the prophets. Then, explain how the OT Prophets alter the expectations of that day. Finally, explain how Jesus's second coming will be similar to the OT Day of the Lord and how it will be different. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. What was the average Israelite expecting would happen on the Day of the Lord? \n2. What did the prophets teach that corrected this misunderstanding? W  at's the significance of these changes? \n3. What type of messiah was Israel expecting? How do Micah's and Isaiah's prophecies about the coming messiah fit with Jesus's first coming? How about his second coming?\n\n**Before the prophets, the Day of the Lord was viewed in a way that heavily favored the Israelites. It was thought that something physical and/or geopolitical would happen in the world to signify the day. In addition, they thought Israel would be restored. Because they thought that they were the center of the world, Israelites thought that all Gentiles would be destroyed on the Day of the Lord. However, all of these things were entirely wrong, and the prophets informed the people that almost the exact opposite would happen. Israel would not be restored, but made equal in nearly every way to the Gentiles in the eyes of the Lord. In addition, the Gentiles and Jews alike would be lifted up if they followed the one God would send (later revealed to be Jesus). It was also said that there would be no escape for anyone, Jew or Gentile alike, when the Day of the Lord comes. Every person on Earth would face judgement on that day. Jesus' return will be similar top the OT view in that it is a very important day, but it will not be anywhere near as Israel-centric as they thought it would be.\n\n**","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.471522235Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/Ezekiel":{"title":"","content":"\n*Theme: New Life*\n\n## Ezekiel in Babylonian Exile\n\n- 592 BC\n- Mentally travels back to Judah through visions/dreams\n- Talks a lot about complacency\n- Who are the Righteous/Remnant?\n- Glory Cloud of God\n\t- Reference to Exodus from Egypt, leading by cloud/fire\n\t- Cloud can *lift* from the temple because *God does not live in objects* (temples, clouds, etc.)\n\n## Key Chapters\n\n- Ch. 1: The Glory of the Lord Appears in Babylon\n\t- Ezekiel is 30 years old\n\t- Ezekiel is a priest turned prophet\n\t\t- Priest: Temple worker, mostly Levites\n\t\t- Prophets: Chosen by God directly, usually stranger types of people\n\t- Receives \"visions\" from God\n\t- Visions begin in 592 BC\n\t- Sees 4 living creatures (human, lion, ox, eagle) move in all directions, eyes all around, holding up a throne, upon which sits the likeness of a human (likely God, but *could be* Jesus)\n\t\t- The 4 creatures look a lot like the Mesopotamian deities to prove a point about God's supremacy over them\n\t\t- Heavenly quad-copter\n- Ch. 2-3, 33: Ezekiel is called to be a prophet to the rebellious house of Israel\n\t- \"Son of man\": Liaison between heaven and earth\n\t\t- This is one of Jesus' functions as well (Jesus does it through parables)\n\t- \"Navi\" (spokesman)/\"Roeh\" (seer): A representative for the divine\n\t- \"Watchman\": warns of doom\n- Ch. 4-5, 12-13, 37: Sign Acts of Jerusalem's Destruction\n\t- Bound and Silent\n\t- Engraved Brick\n\t\t- Image of a city engraved onto the brick\n\t\t- Make model defenses for the brick\n\t\t- Implement an enemy for the brick\n\t- Lying on his Side for a total of 430 days\n\t- Dung Fire\n\t\t- Can make/eat barley bread, has to use cattle feces as fuel for the fire\n\t- Beard Shavings\n\t\t- Cuts beard with a sword\n\t\t\t- 1/3 goes to a fire\n\t\t\t- 1/3 is finely chopped by the sword\n\t\t\t- 1/3 carried by the wind\n\t- Exile's Baggage\n\t\t- Travels into exile as a sign\n\t- Eating and Quaking\n\t\t- Sign of Judah's future anxiety from the Babylonians\n\t- Altering Proverbs and Prophecies\n\t\t- Proverb will be put to an end (12:21 and following)\n\t- The 2 Sticks\n\t\t- 2 sticks become 1, represent union of Ephraim and Judah\n\t\t- Comes through Jesus on the Cross\n- Ch. 6-9: Coming Destruction of Jerusalem because of Idolatry\n\t- Ezekiel is taken by his hair (ouch) to the temple of the Lord\n\t- He is shown that Israel is *driving God out of the temple*\n\t\t- The temple is being used for idols\n\t\t- Shows Ezekiel that being a priest doesn't mean what it used to\n- Chapter 10: YWYH's Glory leaves Jerusalem\n\t- When he leaves he goes ahead of Israel to Babylon\n- Chapter 11: 16-20: A *New Heart* and restored land for the remnant of Israel\n\t- God gives the *ability* to choose good vs. evil, but it is still up to us to choose good over evil\n- Chapter 16: 30-33: God's choice bride plays the *prostitute* and worse\n\t- Israel *pays* their \"lovers\" for \"illicit favors\"\n- Chapter 18: 1-4, 20: Each generation is held responsible for their own sins\n\t- Generations do not suffer for each other, but only for themselves\n- Chapter 34: 7-10, 15-16, 23: Good and bad shepherds\n\t- Who were Israel's bad shepherds\n\t- YHWH and his King (a King of his choice) would be good shepherds\n- Chapter 36: 22-28; 37:1: A new spirit for a dead nation to revive God's reputation\n\t- God will recover the reputation and power associated with his name by raising up the dead nation of Israel *for his reputation*\n- Chapter 40-43: heavenly-earthly temple filled with YHWH's glory\n\n## Main Themes\n\n1.

Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response","content":"# Why Is All of This Happening? Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response\n## Who is Responsible for Evil?\n\n- *Rāh* in Hebrew is \"hardship\", \"trouble\", or \"disaster\"\n- God brings about both good and *rāh* (trouble)\n\n## Where does evil come from?\n\n- Materialists blame natural causes\n- Atheists say Christians can only blame God\n- Some Christians say evil doesn't exist\n- Some Christians are *overly* interested in evil\n\n## Complex Problem: 5 Answers\n\n### 1. Ourselves\n\n- We are tempted by our own desire (James 1:13-15)\n- We are the ones who sin (Joshua 7:20)\n- More examples: Uzzah, Nadau, Ananias, Mirian, and Barabbas\n\n### 2. Other Humans\n\n- Humans can be malicious towards other humans (Daniel 3:8-12)\n- Story of Stephen (Acts 7:54-58)\n\n### 3. Demon(s)\n\n- Satan has angels (Rev. 12:9, 12)\n- Satan himself \"prowls around\" (1 Peter 5:8)\n- The Bible speaks of cosmic powers and spiritual forces (Eph 6:12)\n- Paul warns about sacrificing to demons (1 Cor. 10:19-20)\n\n### 4. God\n\n- God can bring down curses (Amos 4:9)\n- God brings judgement (1 Cor. 11:19-30)\n\t- Examples: fire, serpents, other nations, etc.\n- Not necessarily a source of \"evil\" but of \"judgement\" that from a human perspective seems unfair\n\n### 5. Accidents\n\n- Abraham just died (Gen 25:8)\n- Storms come (Matt 8:23)\n- Disease/injury just happens (Mark 5:25)\n- Accidents just happen (Deut 19:5)\n\n## Responding to Evil\n\n- Discerning the source is difficult\n- Knowing that there are different sources keeps one grounded\n\t- Keeps blame from God\n\t- Restricts power to Satan\n\t- Encourages taking responsibility for one's sins\n\t- Encourages an attitude of grace","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.475522234Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/To-whom-does-the-power-of-salvation-belong":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.475522234Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/Top-15-College-Proverbs":{"title":"Top 15 College Proverbs","content":"\n## Topics\n\n### Sleep\n\n- Proverbs 20:13 and 3:21-24\n- Lesson and Meaning: If you have done well during the day, you'll sleep better.

Training people to serve in the Royal Court\n\n\t- Connections to the Elite\n\t- Royal Etiquette (Proverbs 23:1-3; 25:6-7; Ecclesiastes 10:20)\n\t- How do we handle those in power (Whether they do right or wrong)?\n\n2.

BC): 30 sayings that are parallel (nearly identical) to Proverbs 22-23\n\t\t- This tells us that much of this wisdom is *universal*\n\t\t- It also tells us that an ungodly person can still have wisdom, so it is important to listen to and process all advice given, regardless of source\n\n## Structure\n\n7 Pillars:\n\n- Solomon \n\t- Chapters 1-9\n\t- Chapters 10-22\n\t- Chapters 25-29\n- Words of the Wise\n\t- Chapters 22-23\n\t- Chapters 24\n- Agur\n\t- Chapter 30\n- King Lemuel\n\t- Chapter 31\n- A few Repeat Proverbs (10:1 $\\parallel$ 15:20)\n- Thematic Unity: grouped on \"Laziness\" (26:13-16)\n\n## Main Theme: \"The Fear of YHWH\"\n\n- Intro (1:7), Conclusion (31:30), 20 times throughout\n- What is it?\n\t1.

active in the *10/40 window*\n\n## Main Points from 10/40\n\n- The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Windows analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represents\n\t- 82% of the poorest of the world's poor\n\t- 84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy)\n\t- The hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.)\n\t- Close to 100% of those who are both most poor and have least access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)\n\t- The least Christian resource investment and least sharing of the Christian message\n\n## Early Center of Missionary Activity (Final material)\n\n| Center         | Reach/Important Details                               | \n|

Importance of Preparation\n- Importance of Organization and Leadership\n- Faithfulness does not always mean numerical success\n- Often receptivity comes after years of preaparing difficult soil\n- God can use a few, dedicated people to accomplish much\n- God works with us, in spite of us, and without us\n- God's work will be accomplished\n\n[The Origin of Our

Gain insight by understanding other interpretations about the Bible\n2. Understand the present religious world and how it came about\n3. Learn how others dealt with similar problems\n\n# \"History is a Story Written by the Finger of God\" (C.S. Lewis)\n\n- Ordinary historians either deny or are uncertain of God's influence on history\n\t- They look at how people affect the story of the church, not looking to God as the explanation\n\t- They may allow the idea of God affecting history, but do not specify how he may be acting\n\t- *Note*: ordinary historians can still be believers, but may feel unqualified to assert God's influence in the period they study\n- \"Open\" and \"Closed\" secular (ordinary) history\n\t- Open: God can work in history\n\t- Closed: God cannot (leads to naturalism)\n- We should at least *try* to spot God's fingerprints in history\n- Theological Historians (*Providentialists*) say that God's influence in history is certain\n\t- They recognize the \"irreducible complexity of human experience\"\n\t- Though they should be willing to discuss God's influence but to be *cautious*, using documentation and sound reasoning before claiming God's involvement for a given event\n\t- This approach to history can explain human experience better than pure naturalism/materialism can\n- Both historical approaches are valid for different reasons\n- Secular explains what happened and why\n- Theological searches for God's hand and to seek lessons from it\n\n# The Medieval Church\n\n- Reform in Head and in Members\n\t- Head = Pope/Papacy\n\t- Members = Organizations/Churches\n- Changes from the NT church\n\t- Organization\n\t\t- Monepiscopacy/hierarchy/papacy\n\t\t- Clergy/laity distinctions\n\t\t- Church competing with state for political power and influence\n\t- Doctrine\n\t\t- Trinitarian\n\t\t- Head = Pope instead of Christ\n\t\t- [Sacraments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament)\n\t\t- Indulgences\n\t\t- Sprinkling/pouring vs immersion\n\t\t- Infant baptisms\n\t\t- Baptism was separated from faith and repentance\n\t\t- Purgatory\n\t\t- Intercession of the saints (\"Hey Mary, ask God for this...\")\n\t\t- Just Wars (allowed wars)\n\t\t- Holy Wars (\"Godly\" wars, crusades)\n\t- Changes in worship\n\t\t- Images and statues\n\t\t- Instrumental music introduced\n\t\t- Less participation by laity (Note: Everything was in Latin)\n\t\t- Vestments (special robes) worn by priests\n\t\t\t- Fun fact: connected to academic regalia\n\t\t- Eucharist received infrequently (once a year)\n\t\t\t- Note: offered much more frequently than that\n\t\t- Eucharist converted to Mass (reenactment of the passion)\n\t\t\t- Transubstantiation (the bread and wine turn *literally* into the body/blood of Christ)\n\t\t\t- Laity refused the cup (communion in one kind)\n\t\t\t\t- The communicant received communion through the priest, and pouring the cup without spilling was difficult and \"risky\"\n\t\t\t- \"ocular\" or \"spiritual\" communion\n\t- Changes in Life\n\t\t- No longer viewed as aliens and strangers (Christendom)\n\t\t- No more missionary zeal\n\t\t\t- if everyone in the society is Christian, then no need for evangelism (except for crusades of course...)\n\t\t- Ethical demands of the gospel only for a chosen few\n\t\t- Ritual more important than morality\n\t\t\t- Not being literally perpetuated, but culturally perpetuated\n- Seven Sacraments\n\t1. Baptism\n\t\t- Child baptisms were common because of Original Sin doctrine (commonly held back then)\n\t\t- This also only took care of pre-baptismal sin according to their doctrine (feeds into later sacraments)\n\t2. Confirmation\n\t3. Eucharist\n\t4. Penance\n\t\t- Procedure for gaining forgiveness of post-baptismal sin\n\t\t- Became a precondition for receiving the Eucharist\n\t\t- Elements:\n\t\t\t1. Contrition (I feel bad about this thing)\n\t\t\t2. Confession (Hey priest, I did this thing)\n\t\t\t3. Absolution (I am forgiven by God of this thing)\n\t\t\t4. Satisfaction (Let me make it up to whom this thing affected)\n\t\t\t\t- What happens if you die before satisfaction but after absolution? (see Purgatory)\n\t1. Marriage\n\t2. Ordination\n\t3. Extreme Unction (Final Anointing)\n- Purgatory\n\t- Where you go when you die *after* absolution and *before* satisfaction\n\t- Temporary suffering for unsatisfied sin\n\t- This allows people to pay off their satisfaction and enter the presence of God\n- Indulgences\n\t- Started to become akin to bribery/paying one's way into heaven\n\n# Avignon Papacy\n\n- Pope Clement V moves the papacy into Avignon, France\n- (Retroactively) nicknamed the \"Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy\" (70 years)\n- All of the popes from this period are French popes\n- All weak\n- All controlled by the French kings\n- No one liked this (except the French)\n- Ends when the seventh pope moves back to Rome\n\t- He thought it was temporary, it wasn't\n\t- Dies in Rome, next pope stays in Rome as well\n# Great Papal Schism\n\n- After Avignon, Urban is elected pope and goes nutzo (dictator-tot)\n- Everyone hates Urban so the vote is recast, and the \"new\" pope is housed back in Avignon\n- Now there are two popes\n- Europe splits based on loyalty to the Avignon or Roman pope\n- Conciliarism\n\t- Fix the schism by subjecting the pope to the authority of a general council\n\t- Pierre d'Ailly and Jean de Gerson: important figures for assembling councils\n\t- Important councils\n\t\t- Pisa: deposed 2 popes, elected a third (the two active popes refuse to yield to the council, so there are now three active popes)\n\t\t- Constance: deposed 2 popes, third resigns, ends schism\n\t\t- Basel: elected unrecognized pope (Felix), ends conciliarism, leaving Eugenius\n\n# John Wyclif\n\n- Englishman, lived through the Avignon Papacy, was skeptical of the pope\n- Well educated Oxford professor\n- Protected by the King, so is free to state his mind about biblical topics without repercussion from the papacy\n- Aided in some of the first English translations of the Bible\n- Followers of his were called Lollards\n\n# Charles IV\n\n- Half-\"Czech\" (Half-Bohemian)\n- Moves HRE capital to Prague\n- Founds University in Prague (1348)\n- Has many church buildings established\n- Sets up the system so that his children could also be HREmperors\n\t- Vaclav IV\n\t\t- Firstborn, becomes HREmperor\n\t\t- Incompetent as a ruler\n\t\t- The worst choice for a ruler\n\t\t- HRE has a disease and a crime wave under his rule\n\t- Sigismund\n\t\t- Married off to be King of Hungary\n\n# Jan Hus (based boi)\n\n- Attend's Charles' University in Prague\n- Begins teaching at the university\n- Ordained priest\n\t- Bethlehem Chapel\n- Preached in Czech\n- Preached of moral reform within the church\n- Czech students studying at Oxford bring back Wyclif's writings, spreading their popularity\n- 3 groups concerning Wyclif's writings\n\t- Some thought it was heretical (mostly German)\n\t- Some thought it was good (mostly Czech)\n\t- Some thought it was worth discussing from an academic perspective\n- Hus takes great influence from Wyclif\n- *De Ecclesia* (On/About the Church)\n\t- Lifts Wyclif's words\n- Didn't believe all of Wyclif's teachings, but not all\n\t- Believed Jesus was head of the church\n\t- Believed Scripture was the highest authority (not Pope)\n\t- Believes transubstantiation (opposite Wyclif)\n- Loses the support of the King (Vaclav, though Sigismund was the elect/in charge by the time of Hus' death)\n- Hus guaranteed safe passage to/from Constance\n\t- Does not have it in writing\n\t- Wrongly arrested in Constance, burned at the stake there after refusing to renounce his teachings (6 July, 1415)\n\t\t- Almost exactly 1 century before the Protestant Reformation's birthday\n- Hus remains in contact with Jakoubek of Stříbro while in prison, they agree to allow the laity to take communion in both kinds\n- After Hus' death, Jakoubek becomes the de facto leader of the Hussite movement\n\t- Much more radical than Hus\n- Reformation vs Restoration\n\t- \"Fixes\" vs remodeling\n- Hussite Movement\n\t- Motto: \"Truth prevails (over all)\"\n\t- Symbol: chalice (representing communion in both kinds)\n- Taborites\n\t- Gathered on a mountain, formed a town\n\t- Town and mountain named Tabor (other gathering spots for Hussites were named Biblically)\n\t- These were radicals even among Hussites\n\t- Mountaintop preaching topics\n\t\t- NT is sufficient\n\t\t- Human ritual is unnecessary\n\t\t- Priests need to live, but mandated tithes are abolished\n\t\t- etc.\n- Hussite Groups\n\t- Utraquists (moderates)\n\t\t- Leader: Jan Rokycana, archbishop\n\t- Orphans/Taborites (Radicals)\n\t\t- Leader: Jan Zizka (military), Nicholas Biscupec (bishop/senior)\n\t\t- Only called orphans after Zizka died (womp womp)\n- Four Articles of Prague\n\t- Communion in both kinds\n\t- Free preaching of the Word of God (of qualified individuals aka. priests)\n\t- Exclusion of the clergy from owning property and exercising influence in politics\n\t- Punishment of mortal or public sins\n- First Prague Defenestration (defenestratees definitely died on this one)\n- Decision at Cheb\n\t- \"the law of God, the practice of Christ, of the apostles and of the primitive church, along with the councils and teachers who are truly based on it\" would be \"received as the truest and impartial judge.\"\n\t- Importance: first and only time in history that the Roman Catholic Church (represented by official delegates) has recognized any authority above and outside the church (they didn't honor this agreement)\n- Prague/Jihlava/Basel Compacts\n\t- Utraquists agree to merge with Catholics if granted communion in both kinds, Taborites hate this\n\t- They also agree to recognize Sigismund as King of Prague, which Taborites also hate\n- Battle of Lipany/Defeat of Taborites\n\t- Both Taborite and Utraquist forces are weakened, Taborites are eventually wiped out\n- Petr Chelčický left the Taborites after decision over war was made\n\t- Continued writing, gathered disciples\n\t- Eventually formed the Unity of Brethren\n\n# Erasmus of Rotterdam\n\n- \"Prince of the Christian Humanists\"\n- Critic of Church and of Luther\n- *Praise of Folly* was an unrelenting attack on the corruption of the clergy\n- Doesn't want to leave the church, wants reform\n- Erasmus despises Luther's division, so breaks in ideology with him\n- Hated by both Catholics and Lutherans\n- Reform through education and a return to the primitive sources (the Bible/Church fathers)\n- Believed that reform should occur through discourse and persuasion (as opposed to senseless burning at the stake)\n- Published first Greek edition of NT in 1516\n\t- Collects many manuscripts to publish the entire NT as a single volume\n- Translation Errors of the Vulgate Identified by Erasmus\n\t- Marriage as \"sacramentum\" = mystery\n\t- \"Do penance\" = \"repent\"\n\t- Mary \"gratia plena\" = \"favored one\"\n\t- Mention of the Trinity in 1 John 5:7-8\n- 3 radical elements of Erasmus' theology\n\t- Envisioned restoration of primitive (NT) Christianity\n\t- Aversion to dogma\n\t- The Spirit against the flesh and the spirit against the letter (less attachment to the physical)\n- Influence on reformers\n\t- Importance of the Bible\n\t- Importance of the Biblical languages\n\t- Importance of church fathers vs. scholastic doctors (middle age theologians)\n\t- A sacramental theology that life of the spirit is not nourished by external, material things\n- \"How does ignorance contribute to \\[understanding of Holy Scripture\\]?\"\n\n# Luther and the Protestant Reformation\n\n- Luther\n\t- Laywer turned Friar\n\t\t- Caught in a thunderstorm, makes a vow\n\t- Influenced by teachings of Augustine\n\t- Friars vs. Monks\n\t\t- Monks stay in the monastery, Friars are monks that leave the monastery\n\t- Believed himself to be a great sinner, hated God in some moments because he felt judged (despite being an upstanding man)\n\t- Ordained priest\n\t- Takes a trip to Rome for church business and is disgusted by the worldliness of the other priests\n\t- Mentored by Staupiz\n\t\t- \"Luther! Commit a real sin then make a confession!\"\n\t\t- Told Luther to go to Wittenberg to get his doctorate\n\t- Frederick (the Wise) of Saxony\n\t\t- Founds University at Wittenberg\n\t\t- Eventually protects Luther after his break from the church\n\t- Luther begins teaching at Wittenberg and also becomes the parish priest\n\t- Discovers repentance over penance (justification by faith, Rom 1:17)\n\t- 3 Solas of Protestantism\n\t\t- Sola fide (salvation by faith alone)\n\t\t\t- Imputed righteousness: Righteousness \"borrowed\" from Jesus\n\t\t- Sola gratia (salvation by grace alone)\n\t\t- Sola scriptura (salvation by scripture alone)\n\t- Albert of Brandenburg\n\t\t- Commits simony by purchasing a bishopric for another town (tries to hold two bishoprics)\n\t- Nails the 95 Theses on Oct 31, 1517 (birthday of the Protestant Reformation)\n\t\t- Chooses this day for the publicity, people come in to see Frederick's relics\n- 3 of Luther's most important works\n\t- Address to the Christian Nobility\n\t\t- Priesthood of all believers (Magisterial reform)\n\t- Babylonian Captivity of the Church (not to be confused with Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy)\n\t\t- Eliminates most of the sacraments (retains Baptism and Eucharist, confession has some value)\n\t- Freedom of a Christian\n\t\t- Free from Church Laws; justification by faith alone\n- Term \"Lutheran\" was applied to followers early on\n- Papal Bull required that Luther report to Rome\n- Upon receiving it, Luther burns the Bull publicly\n- Luther becomes an outlaw in the HRE\n- Charles V becomes Pope, aims to get on the good side of the German nobles (some are Lutheran, some are Catholic)\n- Luther was invited under safe conduct to come to the Diet of Worms (April 18, 1521)\n\t- Luther knows the story of Jan Hus, but goes anyway\n\t- Upon the start of the inquisition, Luther takes a day to think\n\t- Luther gives famous answer (\"I cannot retract and I will not retract.

M:N (many to many)\n\t\t\t- a -\u003e-\u003e b and b -\u003e-\u003e a\n\t\t\t- If alone together in relation, key must be composite of both\n\t\t\t- Any other attributes which may be added must be functionally determined by entire composite key\n\t\t\t- If a new attribute expands the key, the theme has changed and the relation should be renamed\n\t\t\t- Two different M:N relationships will need two different relations\n\t\t\t- Example: H# and CRN (a student can take multiple classes, a class can have multiple students)\n\n## Assessing Structure of an Existing DB\n\n- Count rows and examine columns\n- Examine values and interview to determine:\n\t- Multivalued dependencies\n\t- Functional dependencies\n\t- Candidate keys\n\t- Primary keys\n\t- Foreign keys\n- Assess validity of referential integrity constraints\n\n## Normalize or Not?\n\n- Pros\n\t- Eliminate modification anomalies\n\t- Reduce duplicate data\n\t- Enhance data integrity\n- Cons\n\t- More complicated SQL for queries\n\t- Slower DBMS (more work)\n- Updatable (writeable) vs Read-Only\n\t- Different design guidelines and priorities\n\t- Duplication/Denormalization is OK for read-only\n\t- Joined tables may be stored for read-only\n\t- Know when to break the rules\n\t\t- Example: Student(\u003cu\u003eSSN\u003c/u\u003e, Name, Street, City, State, Zip)\n\t\t\t- Not in 3NF or BCNF because Zip -\u003e (City, State), but is not a candidate key\n\t\t\t- Fix: Split\n\t\t\t- Issues of fixing:\n\t\t\t\t- Table loses ease/speed of access\n\t\t\t\t- Loss of stability of zip codes\n\n# The Data Model\n\n- A plan/blueprint for a database design\n- More generalized/abstract than a database design\n- Easier to change than a database design, appropriate place to visualize concepts\n- Approaches\n\t- ERD - Top Down - Table to Table\n\t- SOD (Semantic Object Diagram) - Bottom Up - Row to Row\n\t- RT (Relational Theory) - Inside Out - Col to Col\n-  ER Model\n\t- Made by Peter Chen in 1976\n\t- many variations, not a set standard\n\t- Rectangles for entity classes\n\t- Diamonds for relationships\n\t- ***Do not*** use \"balloon\" attributes\n\t\t- Speech bubble lookin ahh\n- Cardinality\n\t- Minimum Cardinality: smallest number of instances in a relationship\n\t\t- 0/1 notation (hashmark) (0 is optional, 1 is required)\n\t\t- Min cardinality for marriage states that the relation is 1:1, but could be 0:0\n\t\t- For students and cars, there can be a carless student but not a studentless car (1:0)\n\t- Maximum Cardinality: largest number of instances in a relationship\n\t\t- Maximum Cardinality defines three types of binary relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:N)\n- Multiple Associations\n\t- Possible even likely\n\t- Don't confuse instances\n\t- Ex. Men *can* have married relation to women, only *certain* men have that relation to *certain* women\n- Weak Entities\n\t- Cannot exist without another entity\n\t- Drawn with rounded corners on the rectangle\n\t- Examples:\n\t\t- Dependent w/o employee\n\t\t- Appointment w/o client\n\t- ID-dependent weak entities\n\t\t- Entities that don't have their own key\n\t\t- Ex. Dr. Baird's children didn't have their own insurance keys, they were registered under his\n- Sub/Supertypes\n\t- Generalization hierarchies\n\t- \"is-a\" relationships\n\t- Parent/child concept\n\t- Ideas of inheritance from OOP\n\t- Drawn without a diamond\n\t- Arc between subtypes can be drawn with a number to say how many subtypes an object can have\n\t\t- Ex. arc with number 1 between salaried and hourly worker says that you an only be one of the two\n- Recursive Relationships\n\t- An entity has a relationship with itself\n\t- May be 1:1, 1:M, or M:N\n\t\t- Rules are similar to non-recursive relationships\n\t- Ex. Engine pulls boxcar, *boxcar pulls boxcar*, boxcar pulls boxcar pulls boxcar...\n\t- Drawn by directing the line back to the entity of origin (as you would expect)\n- BOMP Pattern\n\t- **B**ill **O**f **M**aterials **P**rocessing\n\t- Name used for any many to many recursive relationship (regardless of its relation to engineering)\n\t- \"Assembly contains Assembly\" (Part can be made up of other Parts)\n- M:N vs. Association Pattern\n\t- Ex. Student and Course (M:N)\n\t- Where does the grade go?\n\t\t- The intersection, along with the details of a specific student's relation (H#, CRN, etc.)\n\t- M:N are implemented with intersection relations\n\t- Most M:N are in the association pattern\n\t\t- Rare to have an intersection without additional attributes\n- ID-Dependent Relationships\n\t- Multivalued Attribute Pattern\n\t\t- Ex. Company can have multiple phone numbers (phone number will have an optional many to one relationship to company)\n\t\t\t- Stored in table of phone numbers (for multiple companies) with company name as key\n\t\t\t- Phone numbers would then be *ID-Dependent weak entities*\n\t- Archetype/Instance Pattern\n\t\t- ID-dependent child entity is the physical manifestation (instance) of an abstract or logical parent\n\t\t\t- Ex. Painting:Print, Design:Product, etc.\n\t\t\t- The attributes of the instances can be completely different from the parent (ex. a blueprint doesn't have an address, a house does)\n\t\t\t- Key of instance includes the key of the parent\n\t\t\t- Children are weak, children can be represented as non-ID-Dependent (though it is more possible to lose information this way)\n- Business Rules\n\t- Will arise during analysis needed for ERD\n\t- Not part of ERD\n- Helpful Hints\n\t- Look for nouns to determine entity classes\n\t\t- Note: not every noun is an entity class, but all entity classes are nouns\n\t- If you only have one instance, it's not a class\n\t- If there are no attributes, it's not a class\n\t\t- Note the attributes of a class may not be relevant to the table, and it may be valuable to recognize these examples as classes\n\t- Examine and adjust forms and reports\n\t- This is an iterative process\n\n# POI\n\n- Data Independence is very important!\n- Functional Dependency: Given the value of one attribute we can either look up or calculate *exactly* one value for the other\n\t- For example, Name is functionally dependent on SSN (each SSN only has one name attached), but vice versa does not apply (Matt Smith could give two different SSN's)\n\t- In addition, this dependency can be notated with arrows (SSN -\u003e Name), and can be shorthanded to include multiple dependencies ( SSN -\u003e (name, phone, birthday) )\n\t- Implies nothing about uniqueness of either the key or the dependency\n\t\t- Name can be duplicated without regard to SSN (this is pretty obvious)\n\t\t- *However*, SSN could not be in multiple rows\n- Key: a group of one or more attributes which uniquely defines a row\n\t- Key is the attribute that functionally determines the non-key attributes in a relation (the SSN in the above example)\n\t- Underlying applications must be looked at to determine what a key should be\n- Theme: The most important thing about a table (what it stores, in a short descriptive title)\n\t- General rule: if there are multiple themes (the theme contains an \"and\"), the table can be split\n- Note: to redesign a table, you can simply say name_of_table(\u003cu\u003ekey\u003c/u\u003e, col, col)\n\t- The name of the table should *ideally* be related to the theme\n\t- Make sure to underline the key\n- Remember \"One theme per relation\" for the test (DK/NF)\n- Logical db design is the most important skill the class teaches\n- Entity vs. Entity Class vs. Entity Instance\n\t- Semi-trick question: Entity = Entity Class (ex. \"Student Entity\" does not refer to a specific student)\n\t- Entity Instance is a specific example of an Entity (ex. Greg is an Entity Instance for Student)\n- Attribute: Something which describes an entity\n- Classifying Queries using A(E) = V\n\t- Attribute of entity = value (ex. \"hair color\" of \"Greg\" = \"black\")\n\t- Query of \"what is Greg's hair color?\" can be A(E) = ?\n\t- Other examples: A(?) = V, A(?) \u003c V, ?(E) = V, etc.\n\t- Multiple question marks are possible (ex. ?(?) = V could mean \"I have a number. Whose is it, and what does it represent?\")\n- If something is 1:1 and mandatory, it might be better to represent that entity as an attribute of the entity that requires it (ex. every team has to have a head coach so it might be possible to include the coach as an attribute of the team)\n- Null values are fine...?\n\n# ERD Rules\n\n- Put relation *name* in the diamond (ex. store has dept.)\n\t- Do NOT put relation *type* in diamond (1:M)\n- Only make rectangles of *entities*\n\t- Multiple instances\n\t- Has attributes\n\t\t- Note: it is possible (but rare) that there is only one attribute for an entity class\n- Simply determine entities, determine relations (names), and connect them with relation (types)\n- At *minimum*, for a M:N relation the key will be that of both parents combined\n- Intersection relation\n\t- relation that connects two entities\n\t- This relation can have properties (elk problem: this ranger saw this elk at this date at this location aka. ranger sees elk)\n\t- Can name relation in diamond or connect with an entity (more verbose)\n- If the same entity is multiple attributes (ex. two teams play in a game), make two \"has a\" connections between the entities\n\n[[Test 1 Review]]\n\n[[notes/Spring 2024/Database Programming/Exam 2]]","lastmodified":"2025-02-10T19:39:15.479522234Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2024/Database-Programming/Test-1-Review":{"title":"Test 1 Review","content":"1.
