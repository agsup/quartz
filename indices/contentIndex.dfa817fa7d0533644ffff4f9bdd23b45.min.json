We often create evil for ourselves and others as imperfect humans. Evil also sometimes comes into the world through the spiritual war around us. God also sometimes brings down curses and judgement, which to the world looks like evil, and sometimes evil happens through pure accidents.\n\nWe should respond to evil with prayer and discernment, and even if we can't figure out the source, we can do our best to act in a Christian manner, which restricts Satan's power. When others are evil, we should react with grace, and when we are evil, we should take responsibility and work towards cutting the evil out.","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.241003267Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/10x":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Circuits-Report":{"title":"","content":"#Circuits \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Demo-Note":{"title":"","content":"**hi!**","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/OOP-Exam-4-Review":{"title":"","content":"#OOP \n[[OOP]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/Study-Day-SE-Exam-1":{"title":"","content":"# Exam 1\n\n- Question 8: 3 maintenance = corrective, adaptive, and perfective","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/.trash/misc-notes":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/Fall-2023":{"title":"Fall 2023","content":"## Subject List:\n\n- [Operating Systems](notes/Fall%202023/Operating%20Systems.md)\n- [Hymnology](notes/Fall%202023/Hymnology.md)\n- [GUI](notes/Fall%202023/GUI.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/Fall-2023/GUI":{"title":"GUI","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/Fall-2023/Hymnology":{"title":"Hymnology","content":"- [Intro](notes/Fall%202023/Hymnology/Intro.md)\n- [Early Christian Song](notes/Fall%202023/Hymnology/Early%20Christian%20Song.md)\n- [Reformation Movements](notes/Fall%202023/Hymnology/Reformation%20Movements.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/Fall-2023/Hymnology/Early-Christian-Song":{"title":"Early Christian Song","content":"## Prelude\n\n- Church started on Pentecost (50 days after Passover)\n- Church was influenced primarily by Jewish culture\n- Levites were initially assigned as the chorus/band to sing the songs of praise\n\t- This was Pre-Babylon, far before Jesus\n- Synagogues\n\t- Places of worship, not just study\n\t- Invented during Babylonian exile\n\t- Exist all over the world for Jewish worship\n- Instruments were used in Jewish worship, but not in the synagogue (reason unknown)\n\t- Side-note, *a cappella* means \"in the style of the chapel\"\n- Points of focus in early Christian worship\n\t- Fellowship (breaking bread)\n\t- Communion (also called breaking bread)\n\t- Read Scripture\n\t- Pray\n\t- Listen to a sermon (Exhortation)\n- Potential reasons for unaccompanied singing\n\t- Discreetness (during times of persecution)\n\t- Courtesy (noise levels)\n\t- Monetary\n\t- Expertise\n\t- Instruments associated with Pagan practice\n\t- Text was more important than the music\n- Details about the music\n\t- Monophonic/limited harmony\n\t- No notation\n\t- Often had heavy ornamentation on longer syllables\n\t- Most often sung by a cantor, sometimes by a group\n\t- Mostly in Hebrew, but probably switched to Greek around the time of Paul's missionary journey\n\n## Music in the Graeco-Roman World\n\n- Music was seen as magical\n- Doctrine of Ethos\n\t- Music that you listen to has an effect on your life's outcome (Plato/Aristotle)\n\t- Specific keys/chords could affect mood (in more specific ways than we think of today)\n- Intoning important texts\n\t- Intoning: speaking/singing in a specific \"sacred\" pitch or range of pitches to give reverence to a text\n\t- Both Greeks and Christians did this\n\t- Still done today in synagogue\n- Singing In Early Christian Worship\n- Hazzan/Cantor\n\t- Call and Response\n- Poetic Devices in Hebrew Poetry\n\t- Synonymous parallelism\n\t\t- Ex. \"break them with a rod of iron, shatter them like earthenware\"\n\t- Antithetical parallelism\n\t\t- Ex. \"The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish\"\n- Included the Psalms (Jewish chants)\n- First century culture expected the texts to be sung, not spoken\n- Most early hymns are focused on Jesus' majesty/lordship\n- ***Hymnos*** (Greek): words of praise intended to be sung in honor of a deity\n\t- *Note: Will almost definitely be on a test!!!*\n- Vocal, not instrumental\n- Monophonic\n- No common repertoire from place to place\n- May have been solo or congregational (conjecture)\n- Singing was not the focus\n- Core Elements of Early Christian Worship\n\t- Fellowship\n\t- Communion\n\t- Teaching \n\t- Prayer\n\t- Edification\n\t- Encouragement\n- Singing is used as a form of admonishment\n- ***Canticle***: Song from scripture, apart from the psalms and quotations (ex.

that the trinity was not equal parts, but that there was a hierarchy\n\t\t- Arius was refuted, but they were unable to eliminate the heresy\n\t\t- The [Goths of Italy](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fenc\u0026client=firefox-b-1-d\u0026q=Goths+of+Italy) were fond of Arian theology\n\t\t- Arians produced a large number of their own hymns\n\t\t- Date of Easter established\n\t\t- Issued the [Creed of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_versions_of_the_Nicene_Creed) (their list of beliefs)\n\t\t- The conflict with gnostic heresies caused

Declaration of Independence (1776)\n\t\t- Unalienable Rights (Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness) \n\t\t- These rights come from God, not kings\n\t\t- Rights are secured by Government\n\t\t- Government power is derived from the governed\n\t\t- Governed are allowed to overthrow a sour government for their own safety and happiness\n\t\t- States declared as independent and free (each of them individually)\n\t\t- #### About Jefferson...\n\t\t\t- Believed his writing as a young man, turned super immoral later in life though\n\t2. Articles of Confederation (1777)\n\t\t- Strong central government = king = bad\n\t\t- This solution was too weak\n\t3. Constitution (1787, 7 articles)\n\t\t- States become United\n\t\t- Everyone is equal\n\t\t\t- Or, \"everyone\" (men) is \"equal\" (if you're the right race lol)\n\t\t- Unity = power\n\t\t- Government is created and powered by the people\n\t\t- Each state has its own constitution\n\t\t- Each city has its own government\n\t\t- All leaders in every government in the US are elected\n\t4.

Too stubborn.\n\t- A pocket veto occurs in the past 10 days of session, and this kills a bill nearly completely\n\t\t- States don't usually do this, it's mostly a federal thing\n\t- \n- Most bills die because they never make it to the agenda of the committee\n- Speaking of committees...\n    - Committees are where lots of the work gets done\n    - Committees have subcommittees\n        - Ex. Education committee has a K12 committee, a college committee, etc.\n    - Types:\n        - Joint committee\n        - Special/Select Committee\n        - Budget committee (3 types)\n            - Taxing\n            - Spending\n            - Balance (between taxing and spending)\n        - Standing\n            - Workhorses of Congress\n            - They do all of the research/sentiment analysis\n        - Conference (not the same as party conferences)\n        - Ways and Means Committee\n            - Revenue committee for the House\n            - Raises revenue for the Government\n            - First stop for ALL revenue bills\n            - \"Cadillac\" of Committees\n            - Creates exemptions, credits, and \u003cu\u003eloopholes\u003c/u\u003e \n            - Chair: Charlie Rangel (D-NY)\n                - He got caught \u003cu\u003e3 times\u003c/u\u003e not paying his taxes\n                - Kept his position because he helped New York! (cringe!)\n                - New chairman time\n            - Now we have Jason Smith\n            - Now the Committee is \u003cu\u003esuper frikkin Republican\u003c/u\u003e (gross, too partisan!!! yuck!)\n                - Their press releases look like articles from \u003cu\u003eFox News!\u003c/u\u003e\n        - House Appropriations\n            - Spends money to fund government\n            - Appropriation: the legal authorization to expend governmental funds\n            - 12 subcommittees\n            - Pork: Wasteful spending\n            - Always behind...\n        - House Rules\n            - The most powerful committee\n            - Bills must go through this committee to go to the House\n            - Sets a rule for each bill about how debate will occur\n            - MUCH more powerful than even the Senate\n            - New chair is Tom Cole and he's a very, \u003cu\u003every\u003c/u\u003e old looking man\n\n# The Twins\n- Specialization\n    - Members specialize based on prior education/occupation\n- Reciprocity\n    - Members of different specialties agree on a thing\n\n## Seniority\n\n- Unwritten, still powerful\n- Length of time in office = level of seniority\n- Senate Pro Tempore: Longest serving member of majority (traditionally)\n\n## Caucus\n\n- Gathering for a political purpose\n- Gathering of all members of the same party serving in the House/Senate\n- Republican majority in the house calls its caucus the Republican Conference\n\n### Congressional Caucuses\n\n- see textbook\n\n## Leadership Organization\n\n- Institutional Leadership vs. Political Leadership\n    - see textbook\n\n## Majority and Minority Leadership\n\n- Steve Scalise is the Majority House Leader\n- Hakeem Jeffries (young boi) is the Minority House Leader\n- Chuck Schumer is the Majority Senate Leader\n- Mitch McConnell is the Minority Senate Leader\n- Whips\n    - Whips coordinate the party positions (keeps the dogs from running away)\n    - Counts votes\n    - Keeps votes in line\n- Twists arms\n\n## Party Loyalty\n\n- Mavericks: members who show less loyalty to their party and do not abide by informal rules\n    - Based individuals\n    - Actually care about stuff, and talk with other parties to try to get stuff done\n- Floor Lingo\n    - Calendar: list of bill scheduled for hearing/vote (same as committee agendas)\n    - Majority vs. Super-majority\n        - textbook\n- The Well\n\n## Filibusters\n\n- Only in the Senate\n- Unlimited debate\n- Holds progress captive (is cringe)\n- Rule 22 can break a filibuster, requires 60% vote to use\n- Cloture is a vote to end the debate\n- Can be used for good (occasionally)\n\n## Congressional Staff\n\n- Constituency Service is a major task of members' staff\n- Legislative functions include devising proposals, negotiating agreements, organizing hearings, and meeting with lobbyists/admins\n- Members' staff consider themselves advocates of their employers\n- New trend: staffers succeeding their bosses\n- 35,000 employees\n- Committee staff has declined in recent years\n- Minimum personal staff: 18 full time, 4 part time, no limit but budget in the Senate\n- Elected Staff:\n    - Clerk/Secretary\n    - Sergeants at Arms\n    - Chaplains\n\n## Executive/Legislative Tension\n\n- Even if they're from the same party, they don't always get along\n- Even if the President was previously in the legislature  they don't trust each other\n\n## Advise and Consent: Confirming and Ratifying\n\n- Senate confirms President's appointments\n- Senate ratifies all treaties\n\n## Oversight\n\n- Government Accountability Office (GAO)\n\n## Investigation\n\n- Unlimited power (uh oh)\n    - See McCarthyism\n- Congress can investigate whatever they want\n- Viewed super negatively\n- Sometimes turned towards the Executive, making tensions worse\n\n## Impeachment\n\n- House impeaches, Senate holds the trial\n- Johnson, Clinton and Trump were all impeached, but not convicted\n- Nixon saw that he would have been convicted, so resigned\n\n## War Powers Act\n\n- Congress has not used power to declare war since WWII\n- Criticism of the President's role in Vietnam led to the War Powers Act of 1973\n- President may only commit troops abroad for a period of 60 days (90 if including withdrawal)\n- Congress must approve a longer period\n- Nixon vetoed it, veto overruled\n- No matter what, Congress holds the purse.\n\n## Incumbency\n\n- But public disapproval!\n- There are still advantages because:\n    - Staff\n    - Franking (mail)\n    - Publicity/Media Coverage\n    - \"All publicity is good publicity\"\n    - Travel funds\n    - TL;DR, it's much, much cheaper running as an incumbent\n    - Voter apathy pays off for the incumbents\n    - Reapportionment is friendly to incumbents\n- Disadvantages:\n    - Publicly hated (but the hate isn't acted upon)\n    - Like, really, really hated (less than 1/10 of the population \u003cu\u003edoesn't hate Congress!\u003c/u\u003e)\n- Term Limits?\n    - They're not going to do it federally because it's too profitable!\n    - Some states were able to get it done\n\n## Reapportionment and Redistricting\n\n-  Decennial Census\n    - Every 10 years\n    - Only (intended) purpose of this census is purely population (everything else is bonus because `data data data...`)\n- Apportionment\n    - Distribution of voters into districts, dividing of representation by population\n    - Is judiciable (**this is crucial**)\n        - There have been court cases over these (very good!)\n        - Cannot gerrymander based on race (unfortunately party is still on the table)\n- Mal-apportionment is a bad split\n- Reapportionment\n    - The process of redistributing the populations among districts\n- Redistricting\n    - The process of drawing the lines within the States\n- States draw federal rep lines (not Senate because obviously)\n- Gerrymandering\n    - Named for Gov. Eldridge Gerry\n    - Lines drawn for partisan purposes (gross)\n    - Everyone does this, **all of the time.** (they're kinda gross)\n- Packing and Cracking\n    - Packing: putting as many of one party as possible in just one district\n    - Cracking: putting just few enough of one party as possible to that they aren't majority\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.329005275Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/American-Government/Constitution-Study-Guide":{"title":"Constitution Study Guide","content":"\n## Word Pairs\n\n- Power/Authority\n\t- Power = Strength, Authority = right\n- Issues/Politics\n\t- \n- Laswell's/Lenin's definition of politics\n\t- Laswell = authority, Lenin = power\n- Cost/Benefit\n\t- Not always monetary or immediate\n\t- How to value prevention?\n- Make/Enforce Rules of Society\n\t- These go together\n- Elitism/Egalitarianism\n\t- Americans are historically really good at believing in both of these, frustratingly\n\n## Three Questions to begin with\n\n1. The Nature of Man\n\t- Men are not inherently good, so power must be checked using a government\n2. Confederacy or Federal\n\t- Federal is country-level, confederacy is loosely assembled group\n3. Democracy or Republic\n\t- Democracy = short, bloody; Republic = stable\n\n## Three Models - How do Governments Relate?\n\n- Confederation\n\t- Like a club, loosely tied together\n- Federal System\n\t- Like marriage, a union is made\n- Unitary Nation State\n\t- Like a parent-child relationship, one is beholden to another\n\n## Democracy\n\n- Ancient Greek Influence:\n\t- Monarchy/Oligarchy/Democracy\n\t\t- Tyranny (Despots)\n\t- Demos-kratos (the people rule)\n- Democracy/Republic\n- Direct Democracy/Representative (Indirect) Democracy\n- Democratic/Republican Parties\n\n## Republic\n\n- Form of gov in which representatives elected by the people make and enforce laws and policies\n- We are guaranteed this kind of government\n- Representation with the consent of the sovereign governed\n\n## Key Documents\n\n- These need to be known \u003cu\u003ein order\u003c/u\u003e\n\t1.

Separation of Powers/Checks and Balances\n\t\t- Legislative Function\n\t\t\t- Passing Laws\n\t\t\t- Congress\n\t\t- Executive Function\n\t\t\t- Carry out, execute, and implement laws\n\t\t- Judicial Function\n\t\t\t- Interpret Laws\n\t\t- Checks and Balances\n\t\t\t- Ex. Veto/Veto Override\n\t\t\t- Judges appointed by Executive have to be Approved by Legislative\n\t\t\t- etc.\n\t1. Federalism\n\t\t- Calls for political authority to be distributed between a central government and the government of the states (Shared Power)\n\t\t- Federal and state government can act directly on the people\n\t\t- Each has exclusive powers\n\t\t- Political Authority is spread out to prevent power concentration\n\t1. Judicial Review\n\t2. Limited Government with a Living Constitution\n\n- When there is too much power in one place, we split it\n\n## Cases in Chronological Order\n\n- Marbury v.

Why is it so important? How is it achieved?** **(very likely on the test)**\n\t- Conceptual integrity is the maintaining of the original design and architecture when you're adding features. It is important in order to maintain ease of use, maintainability, and construction. Achieved by having a small team of architects (or ideally one).\n8. What is the second system effect? Why does it happen? How can it be avoided?\n\t- The second system effect is where a system designer, after making a successful first system, tries to add too many extra features to the second system, usually leading to failure. It happens due to inflated confidence. It can be avoided by self-discipline, being mindful, and assigning value to functions\n9. How do program space and “size control” affect time and complexity in programming?\n\t- More functionality makes it more complex, and more functionality also means more space, with speed being constant\n\t- Time/Space/Complexity, improving one hurts the other two\n\n## From Schach, chapter 8\n\n10.

Explain why reuse saves more on maintenance than on development.\n\t- Reusable components are well tested and documented which simplifies maintenance, but development is the same because the component still needs to be integrated\n13. Explain the difference between a framework, a library, and a design pattern.\n\t- Framework - a set of cooperating classes that make a reusable design for a specific class of software  \n\t- Library - a set of related reusable routines  \n\t- Design Pattern - a set of interacting classes which must be customized to create a specific design\n14. Give the author’s definition of a “portable” system.\n\t- A product is portable if it is significantly less expensive to adapt it to run on a new computer than to write it from scratch\n15. Why is portability so important for software systems?\n\t- Saves money on development of the adaptation  \n\t- Software has a longer life cycle than hardware, so software will have to be ported an average of 4 times\n\n## From notes on Bass, chapters 1 and 2\n\n16. **Define software architecture. **\n\t- The Software Architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them\n\t- structures system software elements visible properties relationships\n1. Give three reasons why software architecture is important.\n\t- It allows for communication among the stakeholders\n\t- It manifests the earliest design decisions and it defines the constraints  \n\t- It is a transferable abstraction of a system\n2. Briefly describe each of the following types of structures: module, component \u0026 connector, allocation.\n\t- Module Structure - units of implementation; code based  \n\t- Component \u0026 Connector Structures - run-time components and connectors which allow communication among the components  \n\t- Allocation Structures - answer questions about assignments, deployments, and implementation\n3. Describe the parts of the “four plus 1” standard for architecture.\n\t- Logical - module class view  \n\t- Process - component and connector view of concurrency and functionality distribution  \n\t- Development - Allocation view mapping software to development environment  \n\t- Physical - Allocation view mapping processes onto processors and communication nodes  \n\t- +1 - Check all of them against the use cases\n\n## From notes on Tsui, chapter 7\n\n20. Describe the relationship between the functional and non-functional requirements, as related to architecture and design.\n\t- Architecture is the high-level of the system and driven by the non-functional requirements\n\t- Design is much finer detailed, and is driven by the architecture plus the functional requirements\n21. List five examples of architecture patterns.\n\t- Pipes \u0026 Filters  \n\t- Layered  \n\t- Event-Driven  \n\t- Client-Server  \n\t- Three Tier\n\n## From Schach, chapter 7\n\n23. Give several reasons why good modular design is important.\n\t- Reduces cost of maintenance  \n\t- Makes it easier to read and understand  \n\t- Easier to Debug  \n\t- Easier to Extend/Add Features\n24. **Define cohesion.**\n\t- Strength within a module - how well the code belongs together\n25. **List (in order) and briefly describe seven levels of cohesion.**\n\t1. Informational - Operations on the same data  \n\t2. Functional - one operation  \n\t3. Communicational - multiple operations by sequence on the same data  \n\t4. Procedural - related by algorithm  \n\t5. Temporal - time relation  \n\t6. Logical - multiple operations selected by the flag variable  \n\t7. Coincidental - unrelated\n26. **Define coupling.**\n\t- Bond between two modules\n27. **List (in order) and briefly describe five levels of coupling**\n\t1. Data - simple localized data passed  \n\t2. Stamp - pass structure but only use a portion of it  \n\t3. Control - pass flags  \n\t4. Common - global data  \n\t5. Content - reference memory\n28. Briefly describe the steps in the evolution from modules to objects.\n\t- Modules \n\t- Good modules (coupling/cohesion)\n\t- Data encapsulated modules\n\t- ADTs\n\t- Info hiding (public/private sections)\n\t- Object (inheritance)\n29. Explain the concept and benefits of polymorphism, along with any other important closely related concepts.\n\t- Use of a base class that is inherited to make multiple versions of a function, called with dynamic binding\n\n## From Schach, chapter 12\n\n30. Explain what is involved in completing the class diagrams.\n\t- Determine the format of attributes, and then assign methods to the relevant classes.\n31. Explain what is involved in performing the detailed design.\n\t- Data structures are chosen, and specific algorithms are selected\n32. Explain cyclomatic complexity and fan-in/out and compare their effectiveness.\n\t- Cyclomatic complexity - number of binary decisions + 1\n\t- Fan-in - number of flows into a class plus global data accessed  \n\t- Fan-out - number of flows out of a class plus number of data structures updated by the class\n\t- They are all equally effective\n\n## From McConnell, chapter 5\n\n33. **What is the Primary Technical Imperative? Why is it so important?**\n\t- It is to manage complexity. Complexity is a major reason as to why projects fail\n35. Define abstraction and encapsulation and explain how they are related.\n\t- Abstraction - engagement while safely ignoring some details  \n\t- Encapsulation - Forbidding Details\n\t- Abstraction allows high level, encapsulation requires high level\n36. Give some reasons as to why information hiding is important.\n\t- Decreases Complexity  \n\t- Increases Modularity  \n\t- Useful at all levels\n\n## From McConnell, chapter 6\n\n37. Define ADT and class and explain how they are related.\n\t- ADT - Abstract Data Type, collection of data and operations that work on that data\n\t- Class - collection of routines and data that share responsibility\n38. Explain the concept of class inheritance and explain why it is important.\n\t- The purpose of class inheritance is to create simpler code by defining a base class that specifies common elements of two or more derived classes.  \n\t- It's important because it helps us to avoid the need to repeat code and data in multiple locations.\n39. What are the pros and the cons of using class inheritance?\n\t- Pros - Avoids repeating code and data in multiple locations (reuse code without rewriting it)\n\t- Cons - Increases Complexity\n\t- **Reduces redundant code, increases complexity**\n40. What are two things to avoid, related to using inheritance? Why?\n\t- Deep Inheritance, because it is easy to lose track of.\n\t- Multiple Inheritance, because it can be dangerous to your system.\n\t- TL;DR: **Multiple, Deep,

be in Judah, not Bethel/Gilgal)\n\t- Their sacrifice = ineffective\n\n## God's Last Resort (Ch. 4)\n\n- Discipline of various kinds:\n\t- Famine\n\t- Drought\n\t- Pestilence\n\t- War\n\t- Fire\n- \"Prepare to meet your God\"\n\n## Do Not Seek The Altars (Ch. 5)\n\n- \"The altar\" (literal and metaphorical) alone will not save you\n\t- Church and chapel are examples of metaphorical altars\n-

You decide to make your own video explaining how OT prophets also had a message for their own audiences in their own day. Write a brief script for your video. Be sure to include the multiple purposes of OT prophets/prophecy. Also compare and contrast the specific purposes of Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah in their own day. Finally, tell your audience which of these three prophets you want to be more like and why. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. Who were prophets, how did they become prophets, and what did they do/say?\n2. What was going on economically, politically, and religiously in the 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century that called for Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah to prophesy? \n3. What did Amos have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n4. What did Hosea have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n5. What did Isaiah have to say to 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century Israel? \n6. What are the differences between Amos \u0026 Hosea? \n7. Which would you like to be more like and why? \n\n**My Answer: The prophets of the Old Testament became prophets in various different ways. Amos, for example, was a shepherd from the Southern nation of Judah, but after receiving a vision specifically targeted towards the Northern nation of Israel, he decided to become a prophet. Hosea received a direct, vocal request from God to marry a prostitute and continually retrieve her in her infidelity. This was meant to be a direct metaphor for Israel's disobedience and God's loyalty to his people. Isaiah was likely born of a royal family, and was called by God to prophesy, despite his lack of schooling in prophecy. All three of these prophets had very important messages for their day, and I don't understand why people think that they're message is more important today than it was back then. This is such an inane take that I don't even know where to start debunking it. Most of their prophecies directly referenced and discussed issues of Israel's impending demise, it can't get any more clear that these prophets were not just predicting the distant future. Amos directly stated that the land would be consumed and destroyed by using descriptions of fire and locusts. Hosea illustrated Israel's behavior by comparing it to the prostitute that God asked him to marry. Isaiah directly told the powers of the land that alliances will bring them nowhere. If I had to pick one of these prophets to try and emulate today, I would like to be like Amos as he was an effective speaker who traveled to people who he knew needed his message.**\n\n## Q2: Justice \u0026 Mercy:\n\n##### Your church is divided on the issue of whether the God of the OT is a just God or a merciful God. Describe to them how God demonstrated justice against the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. Then, describe how God demonstrated mercy toward the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. End with a couple of suggestions on how human can demonstrate both God's justice AND mercy to their enemies today. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Jonah? \n2. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Nahum? \n3. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Obadiah? \n4. Why it is important for God to be both just and merciful? How does he do it? \n5. Why is it important for us to be both just and merciful? How do we do it? \n\n**My Answer: I think that as a church we shouldn't be asking about whether God is merciful or just. The Bible makes it excruciatingly clear that God is both. In Jonah God's mercy is on full display as he spares Nineveh. However, in Nahum God shows his justice by ending Nineveh after they waste their second chance. In addition, in Obadiah, God's justice and mercy are both shown through a warning to Edom. God shows that he will punish them if they don't change, but will also give them a chance to change before he punishes. It is very important for God to be both just and merciful because God is love. A loving God helps his subjects to change in ways that benefit them and those around them, and this can be either through just punishment or through merciful admonishment. We as Christians need to be the same towards others, but we need to act as peers, not as \"rulers\" over \"subjects\". God is merciful and just through his correction towards people. To be just and merciful towards others we must also correct people, but in a loving way as God does.**\n\n## Q3: The Messiah and Day of the Lord: \n\n##### Pretend a modern day evangelist gets on TV and says the world is going to end in 2030 based on his understanding of \"The Day of the Lord\" and \"The Coming of the Messiah\" in the OT prophets. You have a chance to write a brief response that will be read by the same audience. Explain how \"the Day of the Lord\" was understood by Israel prior to the prophets. Then, explain how the OT Prophets alter the expectations of that day. Finally, explain how Jesus's second coming will be similar to the OT Day of the Lord and how it will be different. \n\n### Prompts to help direct your answer: \n\n1. What was the average Israelite expecting would happen on the Day of the Lord? \n2. What did the prophets teach that corrected this misunderstanding? W  at's the significance of these changes? \n3. What type of messiah was Israel expecting? How do Micah's and Isaiah's prophecies about the coming messiah fit with Jesus's first coming? How about his second coming?\n\n**Before the prophets, the Day of the Lord was viewed in a way that heavily favored the Israelites. It was thought that something physical and/or geopolitical would happen in the world to signify the day. In addition, they thought Israel would be restored. Because they thought that they were the center of the world, Israelites thought that all Gentiles would be destroyed on the Day of the Lord. However, all of these things were entirely wrong, and the prophets informed the people that almost the exact opposite would happen. Israel would not be restored, but made equal in nearly every way to the Gentiles in the eyes of the Lord. In addition, the Gentiles and Jews alike would be lifted up if they followed the one God would send (later revealed to be Jesus). It was also said that there would be no escape for anyone, Jew or Gentile alike, when the Day of the Lord comes. Every person on Earth would face judgement on that day. Jesus' return will be similar top the OT view in that it is a very important day, but it will not be anywhere near as Israel-centric as they thought it would be.\n\n**","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.333005366Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/Ezekiel":{"title":"","content":"\n*Theme: New Life*\n\n## Ezekiel in Babylonian Exile\n\n- 592 BC\n- Mentally travels back to Judah through visions/dreams\n- Talks a lot about complacency\n- Who are the Righteous/Remnant?\n- Glory Cloud of God\n\t- Reference to Exodus from Egypt, leading by cloud/fire\n\t- Cloud can *lift* from the temple because *God does not live in objects* (temples, clouds, etc.)\n\n## Key Chapters\n\n- Ch. 1: The Glory of the Lord Appears in Babylon\n\t- Ezekiel is 30 years old\n\t- Ezekiel is a priest turned prophet\n\t\t- Priest: Temple worker, mostly Levites\n\t\t- Prophets: Chosen by God directly, usually stranger types of people\n\t- Receives \"visions\" from God\n\t- Visions begin in 592 BC\n\t- Sees 4 living creatures (human, lion, ox, eagle) move in all directions, eyes all around, holding up a throne, upon which sits the likeness of a human (likely God, but *could be* Jesus)\n\t\t- The 4 creatures look a lot like the Mesopotamian deities to prove a point about God's supremacy over them\n\t\t- Heavenly quad-copter\n- Ch. 2-3, 33: Ezekiel is called to be a prophet to the rebellious house of Israel\n\t- \"Son of man\": Liaison between heaven and earth\n\t\t- This is one of Jesus' functions as well (Jesus does it through parables)\n\t- \"Navi\" (spokesman)/\"Roeh\" (seer): A representative for the divine\n\t- \"Watchman\": warns of doom\n- Ch. 4-5, 12-13, 37: Sign Acts of Jerusalem's Destruction\n\t- Bound and Silent\n\t- Engraved Brick\n\t\t- Image of a city engraved onto the brick\n\t\t- Make model defenses for the brick\n\t\t- Implement an enemy for the brick\n\t- Lying on his Side for a total of 430 days\n\t- Dung Fire\n\t\t- Can make/eat barley bread, has to use cattle feces as fuel for the fire\n\t- Beard Shavings\n\t\t- Cuts beard with a sword\n\t\t\t- 1/3 goes to a fire\n\t\t\t- 1/3 is finely chopped by the sword\n\t\t\t- 1/3 carried by the wind\n\t- Exile's Baggage\n\t\t- Travels into exile as a sign\n\t- Eating and Quaking\n\t\t- Sign of Judah's future anxiety from the Babylonians\n\t- Altering Proverbs and Prophecies\n\t\t- Proverb will be put to an end (12:21 and following)\n\t- The 2 Sticks\n\t\t- 2 sticks become 1, represent union of Ephraim and Judah\n\t\t- Comes through Jesus on the Cross\n- Ch. 6-9: Coming Destruction of Jerusalem because of Idolatry\n\t- Ezekiel is taken by his hair (ouch) to the temple of the Lord\n\t- He is shown that Israel is *driving God out of the temple*\n\t\t- The temple is being used for idols\n\t\t- Shows Ezekiel that being a priest doesn't mean what it used to\n- Chapter 10: YWYH's Glory leaves Jerusalem\n\t- When he leaves he goes ahead of Israel to Babylon\n- Chapter 11: 16-20: A *New Heart* and restored land for the remnant of Israel\n\t- God gives the *ability* to choose good vs. evil, but it is still up to us to choose good over evil\n- Chapter 16: 30-33: God's choice bride plays the *prostitute* and worse\n\t- Israel *pays* their \"lovers\" for \"illicit favors\"\n- Chapter 18: 1-4, 20: Each generation is held responsible for their own sins\n\t- Generations do not suffer for each other, but only for themselves\n- Chapter 34: 7-10, 15-16, 23: Good and bad shepherds\n\t- Who were Israel's bad shepherds\n\t- YHWH and his King (a King of his choice) would be good shepherds\n- Chapter 36: 22-28; 37:1: A new spirit for a dead nation to revive God's reputation\n\t- God will recover the reputation and power associated with his name by raising up the dead nation of Israel *for his reputation*\n- Chapter 40-43: heavenly-earthly temple filled with YHWH's glory\n\n## Main Themes\n\n1. Don't be complacent, the exile is *your fault*\n\t- Sugar/Cavity Proverb\n\t\t- *The fathers have eaten sour grapes and your children's teeth got set on edge*\n\t\t- The fathers ate badly, but the children got cavities\n\t- Covenanted with nations and idolatry with other gods\n\t- False reassuring prophets, absent shepherds and stubborn people\n2. Exile will be longer and worse than you think\n\t- 70 years full of war, deportations, and the destruction of the Temple\n3. Restoration will follow for a remnant with a new covenant heart, spirit, and temple\n\t-  YHWH is with the exiles, the dead bones rise from the dead\n\n## What to Expect\n\n- Strange images, visions, and actions\n- Some Rabbis forbade those under 30 from reading Ezekiel\n- Unreceptive audience needs \"shock\"\n- Very little about Ezekiel himself\n\n## World Context\n\n- Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon fight over Palestine\n\t- Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah under rule of Assyria\n\t- Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC\n\t- Josiah enact religions reforms in 622 BC (Ezekiel born)\n\t- Babylon rising in power in the 7\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century BC\n\t- Egypt (Pharaoh Necho) allied with Assyria against Babylon\n\t- Josiah (of Judah) tried to stop Egypt from aiding Assyria and died at the battle of Megiddo\n\t- Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin into Babylonian exile along with Ezekiel in 597 BC\n\n## Theological Concerns\n\n1. Who is the remnant? Babylonian exiles or Palestinian survivors\n\t- Whichever is more faithful to God\n2. Whose God is stronger? Babylon's or Israel's?\n\t- God's ability to act through curses shows his power\n\t- Because he actually punishes us, he is real\n3. YHWH is omnipresent\n4.

Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response\n## Who is Responsible for Evil?\n\n- *Rāh* in Hebrew is \"hardship\", \"trouble\", or \"disaster\"\n- God brings about both good and *rāh* (trouble)\n\n## Where does evil come from?\n\n- Materialists blame natural causes\n- Atheists say Christians can only blame God\n- Some Christians say evil doesn't exist\n- Some Christians are *overly* interested in evil\n\n## Complex Problem: 5 Answers\n\n### 1. Ourselves\n\n- We are tempted by our own desire (James 1:13-15)\n- We are the ones who sin (Joshua 7:20)\n- More examples: Uzzah, Nadau, Ananias, Mirian, and Barabbas\n\n### 2. Other Humans\n\n- Humans can be malicious towards other humans (Daniel 3:8-12)\n- Story of Stephen (Acts 7:54-58)\n\n### 3. Demon(s)\n\n- Satan has angels (Rev. 12:9, 12)\n- Satan himself \"prowls around\" (1 Peter 5:8)\n- The Bible speaks of cosmic powers and spiritual forces (Eph 6:12)\n- Paul warns about sacrificing to demons (1 Cor. 10:19-20)\n\n### 4. God\n\n- God can bring down curses (Amos 4:9)\n- God brings judgement (1 Cor. 11:19-30)\n\t- Examples: fire, serpents, other nations, etc.\n- Not necessarily a source of \"evil\" but of \"judgement\" that from a human perspective seems unfair\n\n### 5. Accidents\n\n- Abraham just died (Gen 25:8)\n- Storms come (Matt 8:23)\n- Disease/injury just happens (Mark 5:25)\n- Accidents just happen (Deut 19:5)\n\n## Responding to Evil\n\n- Discerning the source is difficult\n- Knowing that there are different sources keeps one grounded\n\t- Keeps blame from God\n\t- Restricts power to Satan\n\t- Encourages taking responsibility for one's sins\n\t- Encourages an attitude of grace","lastmodified":"2023-09-13T18:59:09.333005366Z","tags":null},"/notes/Spring-2023/Wisdom-and-Prophets/To-whom-does-the-power-of-salvation-belong":{"title":"","content":"## Who are you finding it difficult to forgive?

Training people to serve in the Royal Court\n\n\t- Connections to the Elite\n\t- Royal Etiquette (Proverbs 23:1-3; 25:6-7; Ecclesiastes 10:20)\n\t- How do we handle those in power (Whether they do right or wrong)?\n\n2. Promote Societal Values\n\n\t- Sobriety, discipline, retribution, theodicy, wealth\n\n3. Shapes the Character of the Young\n\n\t- Advice from Father to Son, Mature to Young, Married to Single\n\nWisdom Literature also causes u to wrestle with difficult situations:\n\n- What's the meaning of life?\n- Why am I here?\n- What should I do with my situation?\n\nIllustrates Man's search for God, and God's search for Man\n\n- Diligently sought (Proverbs 2:1-5)\n- A Gift from God (Proverbs 2:6-8; 1 Kings 3, James 1:5)\n- Ask, seek, knock (Matthew 7:7-8)\n\t- to gain wisdom, you must ask for it from God\n\n## Brief Intros to Each of the Wisdom Books\n\nProverbs (Wisdom and Folly)\n\n- A collection of short, universal sayings about God ,his world, and how to make the right decision\n\nEcclesiastes (Seize the Day)\n\n- Classroom discussion about where meaning is found\n\nJob (Endurance)\n\n- An example of the exception to the observable rules of the world and even God\n\n# How to Read Proverbs\n\n\u003e The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.\n\u003e\n\u003e Proverbs 4:7\n\n## What is a Proverb ( *Mashal* in Hebrew )?\n\n- Short, pithy sayings of 1-2 lines\n- Often based on a comparison (26:11)\n- Sometimes a simple observation of life (14:20)\n- Usually has a deeper, spiritual meaning (20:17)\n\n## How to Study Proverbs\n\n- Meanings are not always immediately apparent\n- Requires meditation and thought\n- Read a few Proverbs, apply them to a current situation, and ask, \"Which choice best demonstrates the feat of the Lord?\", or store them away in your mind for later use.\n- You can't learn everything in Proverbs all at once\n\n## Wisdom Built into the Universe\n\n- Sophia/Hocma is personified, influential in creation (8:22-31)\n\t- Anglicized name for this personification is \"Lady Wisdom\"\n- Therefore, Wisdom is observable in the created order\n\t- Ants, locusts, lizards (30:24-31)\n\t- Kings (30:31), wicked (21:12), sluggard (24:30-34)\n- Egyptian *ma'at* (order of the governing world) is a deity married to the wisdom god\n\t- Instruction of Amenemope (mid-2nd mill. BC): 30 sayings that are parallel (nearly identical) to Proverbs 22-23\n\t\t- This tells us that much of this wisdom is *universal*\n\t\t- It also tells us that an ungodly person can still have wisdom, so it is important to listen to and process all advice given, regardless of source\n\n## Structure\n\n7 Pillars:\n\n- Solomon \n\t- Chapters 1-9\n\t- Chapters 10-22\n\t- Chapters 25-29\n- Words of the Wise\n\t- Chapters 22-23\n\t- Chapters 24\n- Agur\n\t- Chapter 30\n- King Lemuel\n\t- Chapter 31\n- A few Repeat Proverbs (10:1 $\\parallel$ 15:20)\n- Thematic Unity: grouped on \"Laziness\" (26:13-16)\n\n## Main Theme: \"The Fear of YHWH\"\n\n- Intro (1:7), Conclusion (31:30), 20 times throughout\n- What is it?\n\t1. Knowing/Trusting YWYH\n\t2. Loving what is good, hating what is evil (2:9, 8:13; \"Tree of Life\" in 3:18; 15:4)\n\t3.

Goals of this Lesson\n\n- To demonstrate God's overarching Plan to save the nations through the people of Israel\n- To encourage us to actively take part in *Missio Dei*\n- Biblical-historical sketch\n\n## Passages\n\n- Matthew 1:1\n- Psalms 110 w/ Matthew 22:41-46 and 1 Corinthians 15:24-28\n- Ephesians 1:3-14 - God's purpose\n- Galatians 3:14 - Our purpose\n\n## Christ's Vision for the Spread of the Gospel\n\n- Acts 1:8-10\n- Beginnings in Acts\n\t- Jerusalem\n\t- To Samaria (Because of persecution)\n\t- Missionary journeys of Paul and his companions\n\n## Spread of Christianity\n\n- Jerusalem\n\t- Base of activity for the 12 apostles\n\t- Although Jerusalem eventually loses the role of HQ, she retains prominence in the movement\n- Syrian Antioch (Acts 13-14; 15-21)\n\t- The first multi-cultural church\n\t- Becomes the first sending church in Christianity\n- Rome\n\t- Hints in Book of Romans (16)\n\t- In time becomes the center of Western Christianity\n- Constantinople\n\t- After the division of Roman Empire, Const is now the center of activity\n\t- Becomes center for Eastern (Orthodox) Christianity\n\t- By Orthodox believers, still considered the mother church\n\n## \"Nestorian\" or Church of the East\n\n- Nestorius (386-451)\n\t- Archbishop of Constantinople 428-431\n\t- Involved with controversy of *Theotokos* eventually condemned for heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 431\n\t- Churches East of Syrian Antioch were called \"Nestorian\" by Western Churches\n\t- Baghdad becomes center of missionary activity for the East\n- They were very active in the *10/40 window*\n\n## Main Points from 10/40\n\n- The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Windows analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represents\n\t- 82% of the poorest of the world's poor\n\t- 84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy)\n\t- The hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.)\n\t- Close to 100% of those who are both most poor and have least access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)\n\t- The least Christian resource investment and least sharing of the Christian message\n\n## Early Center of Missionary Activity (Final material)\n\n| Center         | Reach/Important Details                               | \n|

North Africa, desert monks, monasteries               |\n| Baghdad        | Nestorian, to Far East, India and China               |\n\n## Lessons and Insights from the History of Missions\n\n- Importance of Preparation\n- Importance of Organization and Leadership\n- Faithfulness does not always mean numerical success\n- Often receptivity comes after years of preaparing difficult soil\n- God can use a few, dedicated people to accomplish much\n- God works with us, in spite of us, and without us\n- God's work will be accomplished\n\n[The Origin of Our

We must have the Spirit of God (1 John 2:20-21)\n\t2. Believe in the Truth (John 14:6)\n\t3. Listen to the Spirit (John 16:13)\n\t4. Listen to the voice of truth (John 18:37)\n\t5.
