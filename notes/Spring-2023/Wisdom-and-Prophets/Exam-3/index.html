Amos, for example, was a shepherd from the Southern nation of Judah, but after receiving a vision specifically targeted towards the Northern nation of Israel, he decided to become a prophet. Hosea received a direct, vocal request from God to marry a prostitute and continually retrieve her in her infidelity. This was meant to be a direct metaphor for Israel&rsquo;s disobedience and God&rsquo;s loyalty to his people. Isaiah was likely born of a royal family, and was called by God to prophesy, despite his lack of schooling in prophecy. All three of these prophets had very important messages for their day, and I don&rsquo;t understand why people think that they&rsquo;re message is more important today than it was back then. This is such an inane take that I don&rsquo;t even know where to start debunking it. Most of their prophecies directly referenced and discussed issues of Israel&rsquo;s impending demise, it can&rsquo;t get any more clear that these prophets were not just predicting the distant future. Amos directly stated that the land would be consumed and destroyed by using descriptions of fire and locusts. Hosea illustrated Israel&rsquo;s behavior by comparing it to the prostitute that God asked him to marry. Isaiah directly told the powers of the land that alliances will bring them nowhere. If I had to pick one of these prophets to try and emulate today, I would like to be like Amos as he was an effective speaker who traveled to people who he knew needed his message.</strong></p><a href=#q2-justice--mercy><h2 id=q2-justice--mercy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q2: Justice & Mercy:</h2></a><a href=#your-church-is-divided-on-the-issue-of-whether-the-god-of-the-ot-is-a-just-god-or-a-merciful-god-describe-to-them-how-god-demonstrated-justice-against-the-enemies-of-israel-in-the-books-of-jonah-nahum-and-obadiah-then-describe-how-god-demonstrated-mercy-toward-the-enemies-of-israel-in-the-books-of-jonah-nahum-and-obadiah-end-with-a-couple-of-suggestions-on-how-human-can-demonstrate-both-gods-justice-and-mercy-to-their-enemies-today><h5 id=your-church-is-divided-on-the-issue-of-whether-the-god-of-the-ot-is-a-just-god-or-a-merciful-god-describe-to-them-how-god-demonstrated-justice-against-the-enemies-of-israel-in-the-books-of-jonah-nahum-and-obadiah-then-describe-how-god-demonstrated-mercy-toward-the-enemies-of-israel-in-the-books-of-jonah-nahum-and-obadiah-end-with-a-couple-of-suggestions-on-how-human-can-demonstrate-both-gods-justice-and-mercy-to-their-enemies-today><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Your church is divided on the issue of whether the God of the OT is a just God or a merciful God.

How does he do it? </li><li>Why is it important for us to be both just and merciful? How do we do it? </li></ol><p><strong>My Answer: I think that as a church we shouldn&rsquo;t be asking about whether God is merciful or just. The Bible makes it excruciatingly clear that God is both. In Jonah God&rsquo;s mercy is on full display as he spares Nineveh. However, in Nahum God shows his justice by ending Nineveh after they waste their second chance. In addition, in Obadiah, God&rsquo;s justice and mercy are both shown through a warning to Edom. God shows that he will punish them if they don&rsquo;t change, but will also give them a chance to change before he punishes. It is very important for God to be both just and merciful because God is love. A loving God helps his subjects to change in ways that benefit them and those around them, and this can be either through just punishment or through merciful admonishment. We as Christians need to be the same towards others, but we need to act as peers, not as &ldquo;rulers&rdquo; over &ldquo;subjects&rdquo;. God is merciful and just through his correction towards people. To be just and merciful towards others we must also correct people, but in a loving way as God does.</strong></p><a href=#q3-the-messiah-and-day-of-the-lord><h2 id=q3-the-messiah-and-day-of-the-lord><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q3: The Messiah and Day of the Lord:</h2></a><a href=#pretend-a-modern-day-evangelist-gets-on-tv-and-says-the-world-is-going-to-end-in-2030-based-on-his-understanding-of-the-day-of-the-lord-and-the-coming-of-the-messiah-in-the-ot-prophets-you-have-a-chance-to-write-a-brief-response-that-will-be-read-by-the-same-audience-explain-how-the-day-of-the-lord-was-understood-by-israel-prior-to-the-prophets-then-explain-how-the-ot-prophets-alter-the-expectations-of-that-day-finally-explain-how-jesuss-second-coming-will-be-similar-to-the-ot-day-of-the-lord-and-how-it-will-be-different><h5 id=pretend-a-modern-day-evangelist-gets-on-tv-and-says-the-world-is-going-to-end-in-2030-based-on-his-understanding-of-the-day-of-the-lord-and-the-coming-of-the-messiah-in-the-ot-prophets-you-have-a-chance-to-write-a-brief-response-that-will-be-read-by-the-same-audience-explain-how-the-day-of-the-lord-was-understood-by-israel-prior-to-the-prophets-then-explain-how-the-ot-prophets-alter-the-expectations-of-that-day-finally-explain-how-jesuss-second-coming-will-be-similar-to-the-ot-day-of-the-lord-and-how-it-will-be-different><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pretend a modern day evangelist gets on TV and says the world is going to end in 2030 based on his understanding of &ldquo;The Day of the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Coming of the Messiah&rdquo; in the OT prophets.

It was thought that something physical and/or geopolitical would happen in the world to signify the day. In addition, they thought Israel would be restored. Because they thought that they were the center of the world, Israelites thought that all Gentiles would be destroyed on the Day of the Lord. However, all of these things were entirely wrong, and the prophets informed the people that almost the exact opposite would happen. Israel would not be restored, but made equal in nearly every way to the Gentiles in the eyes of the Lord. In addition, the Gentiles and Jews alike would be lifted up if they followed the one God would send (later revealed to be Jesus). It was also said that there would be no escape for anyone, Jew or Gentile alike, when the Day of the Lord comes. Every person on Earth would face judgement on that day. Jesus&rsquo; return will be similar top the OT view in that it is a very important day, but it will not be anywhere near as Israel-centric as they thought it would be.</p><p>**</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://agsup.github.io/quartz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Greg Supratman using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://agsup.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
