# In John 4:10, what does Jesus mean when He refers to "living water"?

# Clues

In the surrounding text, it is stated that Jesus and the Samaritan woman are by a well. (v. 6, 11, etc.)

The woman is not confused about the water as "living", but about the where the water comes from. (v. 11)

# How does the original language help explain the text?

"Living water", as the Jews and Samaritans understood it, meant flowing water from a river or stream (as opposed to still water from a well).

# What historical background information is helpful?

The well was built by Jacob, and was used by Jacob as well as his sons and his livestock, making it sacred to the Samaritans.

The Samaritan temple that the Jews destroyed was on Mount Gerizim (this can be inferred by John 4:20 combined with the details of Mount Gerizim outlined in Deuteronomy 11:29), which made Jesus' remark about how His living water was better than the water of the well add insult to injury to a Samaritan's ears.

# What are the possible solutions?

One possible solution that is somewhat popular today is that "living water" could refer to nourishment of the soul through belief in Jesus. In John 6:35, Jesus famously confesses that He is the bread of life, but also states that whoever believes in Him will never go thirsty. This quenching of thirst could be from the "living water" Jesus offers to those who ask.

Another possible solution that fits with the chapter's story is that the "living water" Jesus offers is eternal life. Water symbolizing life is a logical association to make, but "living water" (with the definition of "water flowing from a source") would mean life that flows infinitely from a source (Jesus).

# What does this mean for us today?

For us today, I think that both solutions are valid, though the latter solution is more related to the text. Interpreting living water as nourishment to the soul emphasizes the emotional benefits to believing in Jesus. It is stated in other gospels that "tomorrow will worry about itself" (Matt 6:34), but belief in Jesus on it's own can relieve the soul of burdens or worries. This can be seen clearly in the Samaritan woman's change in demeanor towards Jesus upon believing in Him. In addition, interpreting living water as eternal life feeds into the nourishment for the soul of the previous solution. The promise we have of eternal life through Jesus relieves the soul of burdens or worries in the same way as believing the words and nature of Jesus.
