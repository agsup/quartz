"Where does evil come from today and how should we respond?"

Evil comes from many places in the world today. We often create evil for ourselves and others as imperfect humans. Evil also sometimes comes into the world through the spiritual war around us. God also sometimes brings down curses and judgement, which to the world looks like evil, and sometimes evil happens through pure accidents.

We should respond to evil with prayer and discernment, and even if we can't figure out the source, we can do our best to act in a Christian manner, which restricts Satan's power. When others are evil, we should react with grace, and when we are evil, we should take responsibility and work towards cutting the evil out.
