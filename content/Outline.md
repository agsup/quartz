# Early American Psalmody

## Pre-Pilgrim

### Henry Ainsworth

- Separatist, moved to Holland (like many other separatists)
- Cambridge scholar, studied Hebrew
- Joined separatist group in Amsterdam
- Displeased with translation liberties taken in the Old Version for the sake of matching common/ballad meter
- Made his own translations of the Psalms, Songs of Solomon, and Pentateuch, each with commentary on the original Hebrew (Lott, Emory University)
- Instead of prioritizing accuracy or prose, Ainsworth opted for a parallel layout, with an accurate translation on one side and versified version on the other
- Psalter widely accepted by fellow dissenters and often included with the Geneva Bible
	- Geneva Bible: a translation of the Bible made by exiles to Geneva
- Pilgrims took the Geneva Bible and the Ainsworth Psalter with them to America
- Psalter included tunes, but were more difficult than average

## Psalter Development in the Colonies

### Bay Psalm Book

- First book to be published in the colonies (the first printing press in New England was purchased specifically for this project)
- Many churches had resorted to lining out Ainsworth's tunes because of their difficulty
- In addition, many Pilgrims were "Unsatisfied with the antiquated language of the _Ainsworth Psalter_" (Wintle, Library of Congress)
- 10 years after the establishment of Plymouth, Puritans arrive in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, bringing a collection of psalters
	- Old Version
	- Este's
	- Genevan
	- Dutch
	- Ainsworth
- A committee decided that none of them were adequate, so they commissioned the Bay Psalm Book, written by Richard Mather, Thomas Welde, and John Eliot
- The purpose of this book was to make the text more plain and simple, as "Gods Altar needs not our pollishings" (Ganus)
- Included no tunes of its own, referenced tunes from Ravenscroft's Psalter for optional use
- Used 6 meters (Common, Long, Short, Long 6 line, Long Doubled, and Hallelujah 6\*4, 4\*4)

### New England Psalm Book

- Third edition of the Bay Psalm Book
- Improved poetry through significant revisions
- Ninth edition included music from John Playford's *Introduction to the Skill of Musick*, along with instructions for singing (looked at in class!)
	- Cotton Mather (one of the leaders of the Witch Trials) made the *Psaltarium Americanum*
	- No rhymes, optional words included to change from common meter to long meter
	- there is no evidence that this psalter was adopted by any congregation
