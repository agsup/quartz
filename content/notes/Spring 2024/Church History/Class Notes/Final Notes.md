---
- Magdalene Chapel, Edinburgh
- Rented by Scotch Baptists as a meeting house
- Barton Stone/Cane Ridge
	- Tired of Calvinism
	- Gets in trouble with Presbyterians, gets kicked out of the church
	- Cane Ridge Revival
		- Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and nonbelievers joined together for the revival (ecumenical)
		- Many preached and had communion *openly*
			- Closed communion: only communing with those in good standing 1in your congregation and with no one else
			- Open communion was a large point of controversy
		- "Bodily Agitations"
			- Convulsions of various kind
		- "Believe and obey, and you will be saved"
		- They get in trouble with the Presbyterian church for starting the Revival
		- Presbyterian Senate want to discipline the group
			- A part of the Senate separates over this, forms the Springfield Presbytery
	- They believe that presbyteries in principle are unbiblical
- Christian Churches
	- Rice Haggard: you should just refer to yourselves as "Christians"
	- Churches that align with Stone
	- Members are referred to as simply Christians
- The Pillars of the ARM (American Restoration Movement)
	- Unity (no more denominational separation)
	- Restoration (no more corruption/power imbalance)
- They all immerse one another, but do not preach it immediately as they wanted the movement to be as easily accepted as possible
	- Immersed in Stoner Creek (lol)

		- Faith
		- Repentance

	- Meets Campbell and agrees with his mission, slingshots Campbell's movement with his evangelistic flair
- Campbell and Stone movements start to collide and were mostly in agreement
	- Had a few small qualms, were easily resolved through civil discussion (ex. naming of "Christians", etc.)
	- Group motto: "In faith, unity; in opinions, liberty; in all things charity"
		- Borrowed from Richard Baxter

			- Ann kept Adoniram alive, but her health suffered, killing her
			- After Ann's death, Adoniram fell into a deep depression, from which he eventually recovered
		- Went out as Congregationalists
