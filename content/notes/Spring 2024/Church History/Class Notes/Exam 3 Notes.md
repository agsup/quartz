# Reformation in Great Britain

- Henry VIII ("Defender of the Faith")
	- Wanted to annul his marriage with Catherine to marry Anne Boleyn, Pope said no, Henry separates and starts Church of England (Anglicanism)
	- Act of Supremacy: King is head of the church, Pope is stripped of power in England
	- Had daughters Mary ad Elizabeth, and son Edward (who dies young)
- "Bloody" Mary (staunch RomCath)
	- Burned Thomas Cranmer at the stake (Archbish of Canterbury of the Anglican Church)
		- Cranmer tried pushing protestant ideals into the Anglican church
	- Many Protestant bishops and theologians also burned
	- She sucked, and everyone hated her (including some Catholics)
- Elizabeth I (very Protestant)
	- Smarter politically than Mary
	- Doesn't go after Catholics
	- Doesn't want civil war, but also doesn't want to make martyrs out of powerful Catholic Archbish's
		- She was still super violent tho (executed on treason instead of heresy)
	- Ensures victory of Protestantism in England
