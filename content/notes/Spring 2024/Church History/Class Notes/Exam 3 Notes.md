# Age of Religious Wars

###### Long ago, in a kingdom far far away...

- Wars
	- Two Schmalkaldic Wars in Europe
		- Aftermath: Peace of Augsburg
		- "Whose the region, his the religion" (*cuius regio, eius religio*)
			- The ruler of a region determines the religion of his land
	- Civil Wars in France
	- Dutch Revolt from Spain
	- Anglo-Spanish conflict
	- Thirty Years' War
	- English Civil War
- Religion was always a reason, but not *the* reason for these wars
	- Usually a facade for a political goal

## French Wars

- 1593: 3 cornered conflict between Huguenots (Bourbon), Catholic League "Ultras" (Guise), and Royal Family (Valois)
	- Huguenot = French Protestant
	- Huguenot Military Leaders:
		- Admiral De Coligny
		- Louis of Conde
		- Henry of Navarre
		- Henri of Conde
	- Royal Family are also Catholic, but sometimes still battles with the Guise on political issues
	- St. Barth's Day Massacre
		- Murder of Admiral de Coligne (postmortal defenestration)
		- Murders totaling over ~13,000 occur across France and other nations
		- Some Catholics with particularly present moral compasses housed Huguenot refugees
	- Royal view: unity of country means unity of faith
	- Generally, the Huguenots would attack property while the Caths would attack people
		- Both incredibly destructive
	- Eventually through family tree shenanigans, Henry of Navarre is elect to the throne and switches sides
	- Edict of Nantes: (temporary) limited tolerance of Huguenots

# The Thirty Years' War

- Centered around Hapsburg Family (that one super inbred one)
- 5 Phases
	1. Bohemian Phase
	1. Palatinate Phase
	1. Danish Phase
	1. Swedish  Phase
	1. Franco-Swedish Phase
- By the end of the war, the religious aspect of the war fades to the background

## Bohemian Phase

- Third Defenestration of Prague (the most popular Defenestration of Prague)
	- King Ferdinand II (Hapsburg) of Bohemia becomes HREmporer
	- Doesn't aid the Protestants

	- Begins wave of violence throughout Hapsburg lands
- Frederick V crowned King of Bohemia
	- Calvinist, so Lutherans withdraw
	- Reigns very briefly ("The Winter King")
- Johann Tilly (RomCath general)

	- 21 June, 1621

## Swedish Phase

- Ends with the Peace of Prague
- Protestants get the upper hand
- Religious aspect of war wanes

## Franco-Swedish Phase

- Fully political now
- Longest and deadliest phase
- Protestant gain several more victories
- HREmporer Ferdinand III agrees to terms in Peace of Westphalia (Oct 24, 1648)
	- Sovereignty of each state in the HRE
	- Made the HREmporer virtually powerless
	- Whose the region, his the religion (but only if you're Catholic, Lutheran, or Calvinist)
