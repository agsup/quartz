## Reasons for Studying Church History

1. Gain insight by understanding other interpretations about the Bible
2. Understand the present religious world and how it came about
3. Learn how others dealt with similar problems

# "History is a Story Written by the Finger of God" (C.S. Lewis)

- Ordinary historians either deny or are uncertain of God's influence on history
	- They look at how people affect the story of the church, not looking to God as the explanation
	- They may allow the idea of God affecting history, but do not specify how he may be acting
	- *Note*: ordinary historians can still be believers, but may feel unqualified to assert God's influence in the period they study
- "Open" and "Closed" secular (ordinary) history
	- Open: God can work in history
	- Closed: God cannot (leads to naturalism)
- We should at least *try* to spot God's fingerprints in history
- Theological Historians (*Providentialists*) say that God's influence in history is certain
	- They recognize the "irreducible complexity of human experience"
	- Though they should be willing to discuss God's influence but to be *cautious*, using documentation and sound reasoning before claiming God's involvement for a given event
	- This approach to history can explain human experience better than pure naturalism/materialism can
- Both historical approaches are valid for different reasons
- Secular explains what happened and why
- Theological searches for God's hand and to seek lessons from it

# The Medieval Church

- Reform in Head and in Members
	- Head = Pope/Papacy
	- Members = Organizations/Churches
- Changes from the NT church
	- Organization
		- Monepiscopacy/hierarchy/papacy
		- Clergy/laity distinctions
		- Church competing with state for political power and influence
	- Doctrine
		- Trinitarian
		- Head = Pope instead of Christ
		- [Sacraments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament)
		- Indulgences
		- Sprinkling/pouring vs immersion
		- Infant baptisms
		- Baptism was separated from faith and repentance
		- Purgatory
		- Intercession of the saints ("Hey Mary, ask God for this...")
		- Just Wars (allowed wars)
		- Holy Wars ("Godly" wars, crusades)
	- Changes in worship
		- Images and statues
		- Instrumental music introduced
		- Less participation by laity
		- Vestments worn by priests
		- Eucharist received infrequently (once a year)
		- Eucharist converted to Mass (reenactment of the passion)
			- Transubstantiation
			- Laity refused the cup (communion in one kind)
			- "ocular" or "spiritual" communion
- Seven Sacraments
	1. Baptism
		- Child baptisms were common because of Original Sin doctrine (commonly held back then)
		- This also only took care of pre-baptismal sin according to their doctrine (feeds into later sacraments)
	2. Confirmation
	3. Eucharist
	4. Penance
		- Procedure for gaining forgiveness of post-baptismal sin
		- Became a precondition for receiving the Eucharist
		- Elements:
			1. Contrition (I feel bad about this thing)
			2. Confession (Hey priest, I did this thing)
			3. Absolution (I am forgiven by God of this thing)
			4. Satisfaction (Let me make it up to whom this thing affected)
				- What happens if you die before satisfaction but after absolution? (see Purgatory)
	1. Marriage
	2. Ordination
	3. Extreme Unction (Final Anointing)
- Purgatory
	- Where you go when you die *after* absolution and *before* satisfaction
	- Temporary suffering for unsatisfied sin
	- This allows people to pay off their satisfaction and enter the presence of God
- Indulgences
	- Started to become akin to bribery/paying one's way into heaven
