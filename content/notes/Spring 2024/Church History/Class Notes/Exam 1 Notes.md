## Reasons for Studying Church History

1. Gain insight by understanding other interpretations about the Bible
2. Understand the present religious world and how it came about
3. Learn how others dealt with similar problems

# "History is a Story Written by the Finger of God" (C.S. Lewis)

- Ordinary historians either deny or are uncertain of God's influence on history
	- They look at how people affect the story of the church, not looking to God as the explanation
	- They may allow the idea of God affecting history, but do not specify how he may be acting
	- *Note*: ordinary historians can still be believers, but may feel unqualified to assert God's influence in the period they study
- "Open" and "Closed" secular (ordinary) history
	- Open: God can work in history
	- Closed: God cannot (leads to naturalism)
- We should at least *try* to spot God's fingerprints in history
- Theological Historians (*Providentialists*) say that God's influence in history is certain
	- They recognize the "irreducible complexity of human experience"
	- Though they should be willing to discuss God's influence but to be *cautious*, using documentation and sound reasoning before claiming God's involvement for a given event
	- This approach to history can explain human experience better than pure naturalism/materialism can
- Both historical approaches are valid for different reasons
- Secular explains what happened and why
- Theological searches for God's hand and to seek lessons from it

# The Medieval Church

- Reform in Head and in Members
	- Head = Pope/Papacy
	- Members = Organizations/Churches
- Changes from the NT church
	- Organization
		- Monepiscopacy/hierarchy/papacy
		- Clergy/laity distinctions
		- Church competing with state for political power and influence
	- Doctrine
		- Trinitarian
		- Head = Pope instead of Christ
		- [Sacraments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament)
		- Indulgences
		- Sprinkling/pouring vs immersion
		- Infant baptisms
		- Baptism was separated from faith and repentance
		- Purgatory
		- Intercession of the saints ("Hey Mary, ask God for this...")
		- Just Wars (allowed wars)
		- Holy Wars ("Godly" wars, crusades)
	- Changes in worship
		- Images and statues
		- Instrumental music introduced
		- Less participation by laity (Note: Everything was in Latin)
		- Vestments (special robes) worn by priests
			- Fun fact: connected to academic regalia
		- Eucharist received infrequently (once a year)
			- Note: offered much more frequently than that
		- Eucharist converted to Mass (reenactment of the passion)
			- Transubstantiation (the bread and wine turn *literally* into the body/blood of Christ)
			- Laity refused the cup (communion in one kind)
				- The communicant received communion through the priest, and pouring the cup without spilling was difficult and "risky"
			- "ocular" or "spiritual" communion
	- Changes in Life
		- No longer viewed as aliens and strangers (Christendom)
		- No more missionary zeal
			- if everyone in the society is Christian, then no need for evangelism (except for crusades of course...)
		- Ethical demands of the gospel only for a chosen few
		- Ritual more important than morality
			- Not being literally perpetuated, but culturally perpetuated
- Seven Sacraments
	1. Baptism
		- Child baptisms were common because of Original Sin doctrine (commonly held back then)
		- This also only took care of pre-baptismal sin according to their doctrine (feeds into later sacraments)
	2. Confirmation
	3. Eucharist
	4. Penance
		- Procedure for gaining forgiveness of post-baptismal sin
		- Became a precondition for receiving the Eucharist
		- Elements:
			1. Contrition (I feel bad about this thing)
			2. Confession (Hey priest, I did this thing)
			3. Absolution (I am forgiven by God of this thing)
			4. Satisfaction (Let me make it up to whom this thing affected)
				- What happens if you die before satisfaction but after absolution? (see Purgatory)
	1. Marriage
	2. Ordination
	3. Extreme Unction (Final Anointing)
- Purgatory
	- Where you go when you die *after* absolution and *before* satisfaction
	- Temporary suffering for unsatisfied sin
	- This allows people to pay off their satisfaction and enter the presence of God
- Indulgences
	- Started to become akin to bribery/paying one's way into heaven

# Avignon Papacy

- Pope Clement V moves the papacy into Avignon, France
- (Retroactively) nicknamed the "Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy" (70 years)
- All of the popes from this period are French popes
- All weak
- All controlled by the French kings
- No one liked this (except the French)
- Ends when the seventh pope moves back to Rome
	- He thought it was temporary, it wasn't
	- Dies in Rome, next pope stays in Rome as well
# Great Papal Schism

- After Avignon, Urban is elected pope and goes nutzo (dictator-tot)
- Everyone hates Urban so the vote is recast, and the "new" pope is housed back in Avignon
- Now there are two popes
- Europe splits based on loyalty to the Avignon or Roman pope
- Conciliarism
	- Fix the schism by subjecting the pope to the authority of a general council
	- Pierre d'Ailly and Jean de Gerson: important figures for assembling councils
	- Important councils
		- Pisa: deposed 2 popes, elected a third (the two active popes refuse to yield to the council, so there are now three active popes)
		- Constance: deposed 2 popes, third resigns, ends schism
		- Basel: elected unrecognized pope, ends conciliarism

# John Wyclif

- Englishman, lived through the Avignon Papacy, was skeptical of the pope
- Well educated Oxford professor
- Protected by the King, so is free to state his mind about biblical topics without repercussion from the papacy
- Aided in some of the first English translations of the Bible
- Followers of his were called Lollards

- Moves HRE capital to Prague
- Founds University in Prague (1348)

# Jan Hus (based boi)

- 3 groups concerning Wyclif's writings
	- Some thought it was heretical (mostly German)
	- Some thought it was good (mostly Czech)
	- Some thought it was worth discussing from an academic perspective
- Hus takes great influence from Wyclif

	- Wrongly arrested in Constance, burned at the stake there after refusing to renounce his teachings
- Hus remains in contact with Jakoubek of Stříbro while in prison, they agree to allow the laity to take communion in both kinds
