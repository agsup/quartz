## Reasons for Studying Church History

1. Gain insight by understanding other interpretations about the Bible
2. Understand the present religious world and how it came about
3. Learn how others dealt with similar problems

# "History is a Story Written by the Finger of God" (C.S. Lewis)

- Ordinary historians either deny or are uncertain of God's influence on history
	- They look at how people affect the story of the church, not looking to God as the explanation
	- They may allow the idea of God affecting history, but do not specify how he may be acting
	- *Note*: ordinary historians can still be believers, but may feel unqualified to assert God's influence in the period they study
- "Open" and "Closed" secular (ordinary) history
	- Open: God can work in history
	- Closed: God cannot (leads to naturalism)
- We should at least *try* to spot God's fingerprints in history
- Theological Historians (*Providentialists*) say that God's influence in history is certain
	- They recognize the "irreducible complexity of human experience"
	- Though they should be willing to discuss God's influence but to be *cautious*, using documentation and sound reasoning before claiming God's involvement for a given event
	- This approach to history can explain human experience better than pure naturalism/materialism can
- Both historical approaches are valid for different reasons
- Secular explains what happened and why
- Theological searches for God's hand and to seek lessons from it
