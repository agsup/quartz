# Zwingli

- 7 weeks younger than Luther
- Born in Wildhaus, Switz.
- Raised by priest uncle (father was prosperous peasant)
- B.A. and M.A. from U. of Basel
- Returned home to Glarus as its parish priest
- "Sausage incident" (1522)
	- Ash Wednesday (fasting from meat)
	- Not Biblical, therefore not binding
	- City council (not church) rules that it should be observed for good order
- First Zurich Disputation
	- Zwingli presents 67 conclusions
	- City Council rules in his favor
- Second Zurich Disputation
	- Leads to (does not immediately cause) abolishment of relics, images, mass, organs, etc.
	- Protestant/Reformed Communion celebrated on Easter 1525
- Rift between Zwingli and disciples
	- Church agrees to make the changes, but later
	- Zwingli complies, followers do not
- Luther vs. Zwingli
	- Normative (everything is allowable unless stated otherwise) vs. Regulative (only what is explicitly stated is allowable)
	- Lutherans were mostly normative, Reformed (Zwingli's followers) were mostly regulative
- Theology
	- Influenced by Erasmus
	- Views on the Sacraments
		- Fully material/worldly/symbols, have no spiritual pull
	- Symbolic Eucharist (vs. Trans/Consubstantiation)
		- Still has an effect on the heart to remember Jesus' sacrifice, but the material is not mystically changing
	- Baptism is the replacement for circumcision
	- Defended infant baptism, but as a symbol of God's ownership
	- Primary church: known only to God
	- Local congregation: Primary church made visible
	- Universal church: collection of local congregations (less pure)
- Protestant Communion
	- First celebrated on Easter 1526
	- Follows pattern of the Hussites (both kinds)
	- Celebrated 4 times a year (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, Autumn)
- Battle of Kappell
	- Catholics and Protestants fought after Zwingli's excommunication
	- Catholics won decisively, Zwingli was wounded, then killed
	- Corpse was mutilated in a \*creative\* selection of ways
	- Both Lutherans and Zwinglians fear the military might of the HRE
		- Both recognize the value of uniting, but cannot agree on one important theological matter (most vitally symbolic vs consubstantiated Eucharist)
			- Note: modern Lutherans often refer to consubstantiation as sacramental union

# Reformation

- 3 "Radical" Approaches
	- Anabaptists
		- The Bible is the ultimate authority
		- Practiced believers' baptism (which they believed was the only true baptism)
			- Literally means "baptized again"
			- Composed of many different, very separate "heretical" groups
	- Spiritualists
		- The Spirit is the ultimate authority
		- The Spirit provides new revelation, and it can override Scripture
	- Rationalists
		- Reason is the ultimate authority
		- How do you rationally explain the washing away of sins?
- Conrad Grebel and the Swiss Brethren
	- Wanted to go beyond what Zwingli was willing to do
		- Baptized George Blaurock (21 Jan 1525)
		- Immersed Wolfgang Ulimann, who did not want to be baptized "out of a platter" (Feb 1525)
		- Note: Swiss Reformed are different from the Swiss Brethren
	- Thousands die for their beliefs
	- Manz was executed by drowning, Blaurock was burned at the stake
	- They all knew what they would suffer, and none of the leaders lived long after Blaurock's baptism
	- Manz was the first to be executed by Protestant officials (mockingly called the "third baptism")
- Michael Sattler
	- Main author of Schleitheim Confession
	- Inspirational martyrdom
- Baltazar Hubmaier
	- Faith and confession before baptism
	- Denied that baptism was necessary for salvation, but important for the church
	- Accepted Christian participation in lesser government
	- Arrested in Zurich
		- recants at disputation (tortured), later recants his recantation
			- Tortured in prison into recanting again
			- Upon release is exiled, preaches in Moravia
		- Upon being disputed a third time, he refuses to recant and is burned at the stake
