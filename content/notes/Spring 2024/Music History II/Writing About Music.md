title: Writing About Music
---
- Chicago Manual of Style
	- Most comprehensive information about citing musical works, recordings, etc.
	- Can be used with footnotes or in-text citation
	- "Turabian" is essentially the same as Chicago
- Exception: certain fields in music education/therapy use APA

# Sources

- Primary: original documents, autobiographies, diaries, letters, recordings, etc.
- Secondary: Sources that comment on/interpret other works. Usually written after the fact
	- Books, journal articles, liner or program notes, recordings, musical scores
- Age of Sources
	- Secondary: try to stay as current as possible
		- Older sources may contain research that is out of date or no longer relevant
- Don't use Wikipedia (sources at the bottoms of wiki pages are allowed)
- Don't need to cite commonly available information (make sure it's commonly available before deciding not to cite! Includes things like birth dates)

# Where to Start

- New Grove Dictionary (in the music library)
- Oxford Bibliographies
- Google (Scholar)
- Campus Library Search
	- ILL: Inter library loan

# Common Mistakes

- Centuries
	- Hyphenate centuries as adjectives (20th-century composers)
	- Do not hyphenate centuries as nouns (the 20th century)
- Music Titles
	- Unique titles are italicized (*The Unanswered Question*)
	- Titles that describe the form or genre are not italicized (Prelude in D Minor)

# Research Questions

- Starting with good questions helps to guide and focus the study
- Fundamental difference between a report and a research paper
	- Report is a summary of facts
	- Research paper investigates and answers specific questions
- Generally should focus on "how and why", cause and effect, etc.
- Good questions:
	- Focus on a specific problem
	- Detail what will be investigated
	- Explain what we're looking for
- Be careful of:
	- Being too broad
	- Being too narrow
	- Having a one-sentence solution
	- Being poorly defined
