# First Steps

- Develop one or two research questions
	- Need to be answerable with more than a bullet point
- Example: Dvorak's American Compositions
	- Example question: how did Dvorak's American compositions affect the American musical landscape in the long term?
	- Example question 2: what influences did Dvorak have that ended up rippling through future American music?
