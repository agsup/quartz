# Judas

- Free will: Was Judas Responsible?
	- Synoptic picture of Judas
		- "The one later to betray"
		- "What are you willing to give me?" (Judas)
		- Luke 22:3: "Satan entered Judas"
	- John's picture of Judas
		- "He did not believe in Jesus" (6:64)
		- "He was a thief"
		- Daggett: it is not necessarily true that God predestined Judas to betray Jesus
		- "One of you is a devil"
		- Objects to the anointing
		- "He was a thief."
		- Footwashing discourse
		- Satan involved (13:2)
		- Satan enters as Judas takes the bread, similar to synoptics
		- Contrasted with the other Judas, who is a believer
	- Acts's picture
		- Describes Judas' death
- About Judas:
	- Never believed or was close to Jesus (only called Rabbi, always listed last)
	- Consumed with greed
	- He was not "forced" to do this
		- God knew Judas would be this way, but did not force it
- About us:
	- Don't demonize Judas (he could be you)
	- Do we betray Jesus?
	- Do we show worldly or godly sorrow?
		- Worldly ends in death, Godly ends in relief
- Was Judas lost?
	- If he was, it was not because of his death, but because if his unbelief
	- Scripture focuses on his greed/betrayal, not his suicide
	- Only God knows for sure if/why Judas is in hell
