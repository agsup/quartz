title: John 21
---
- *To live a good life is difficult enough, To recover from life's failures is the true measure of a person.*

## Why the Epilogue?

- Greek:
	- Jesus calls them "little boys"
	- Asks if they have any "cooked fish"
		- More than that: "you *don't* have any cooked fish, do you..." (snarky/smug?)
- Peter puts his clothes back on before swimming back to shore
	- He already feels naked before Jesus *with* clothes, much more so without
- Charcoal flame
	- Parallels fire in Jerusalem during Peter's denial
- Fishing?
	- Teaches dependence
	- Verb chosen by John means that "I'm going to fish" is a more permanent statement rather than one made in passing
- Difference that cause the fish to come?
	- Jesus (duh)
	- They obeyed Jesus rather than trying on their own
	- "Cast your nets on the *right* side"
		- Right side was considered "lucky"
- Why did Jesus eat with them?
	- Shows that he's human
	- He's really back (physically and totally resurrected as opposed to being a "ghost")
- Peter
	- The gospel catches <u>all kinds of fish</u> (including Peter)
	- Remembers his calling to be a "fisher of men"
	- God requires faith and trust
- Jesus asks three times if Peter loves him?
	- Mirrors the 3 denials
	- Repetition is necessary for Peter
- Details
	- Jesus asks about *agape* love, Peter responds with *fileo*
		- Peter is hesitant to use absolutes after the last time
	- When Peter was hurt, Jesus had asked *fileo*, as if to question whether he even loved him as a friend
- Feed my sheep?
	- Renewing Peter's calling
- John would never die (rumor)
	- He does, rumor resulted from a misinterpretation from those around him
- John "signs" his book
	- Certifies his truthfulness
