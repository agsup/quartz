## Cause of Absence: HURC

### How can you tell if someone is being truthful?

1. Their character
2. Incentive (what do you have to gain/lose?)
3. Is the story coherent?
4. Simplicity
5. Details
6. Consistency
7. Body language

### Chem Student Story

- "We had a flat tire!"
- Allowed to make up final
- Question 1: easy chem question
- Question 2: *which tire?*

## Santa Example

- If you're not careful, every new piece of evidence can be used to reinforce what you already believe
- Applies to those who believe in witch doctors

### Resurrection Story

- What we have
	- People who don't want to believe   
	- People who are timid and fearful
	- People who succumb to the evidence, and not even immediately
- Marks of Authenticity
	- Details
		- John got there first
			- He didn't go in
			- Told what he saw from the entrance
			- Admits fear
		- Mary was first witness
			- Women were not allowed to be witnesses
			- If story was made up, she would not be viewed so favorably
		- Initial confusion
			- They know that the body is gone, but do not believe that Jesus has arisen, so are confused
- What do we know about Magdalene?
	- Loyal to Jesus (went to anoint, braved the threat of hostile Jews)
	- Previously possessed by 7 demons
	- Supporter of Jesus
	- Distinct from Mary, sister of Martha/Lazarus
	- Says "*we* do not know where they have put Him"
		- "We" refers to other Mary and Salome according to the synoptics
	- The disciples don't take her seriously
	- The fact that a woman was the first witness was used as evidence against the validity of the resurrection
	- God loves to show himself to those who are not valued in society

### Why didn't Mary Recognize Jesus?

- Appearance changed because of the glorification process?
- Jesus described as looking very normal
- *Eyes may have been blurry from mourning for so long*

### Specific Ways of Saying Names

- Jesus: Mary knew the "gardener" was Jesus as soon as he spoke her name
- Example: Jeremy and "D-ness"

### "Don't hold on to me"

- Doesn't mean that Jesus' resurrected form is "fragile" or "ethereal"
- Simply means that Jesus is leaving for heaven

### Day of the Week of the Death of Jesus

- Friday? (next day would have been Sabbath)
- Passover starts and ends with a Sabbath, so Jesus likely died on Thursday
