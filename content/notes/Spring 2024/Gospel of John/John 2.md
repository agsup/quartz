# Wedding in Cana

- Jesus dies *presicely* three years into his ministry at the time that sacrificial lambs' throats are slit on Passover
- This is why Jesus says "my time has not yet come"
	- First miracle "starts a 3 year timer", but God is flexible so Mary was perhaps allowed this exception
- "Woman" as Jesus uses it is in the vocative form (formal but distant)
- "Do what he tells you": Mary gives full control
- The jars at the wedding were used for ceremonial washing
- Jars were filled to the brim, and water was *drawn out* (as if from a well)
	- Daggett suggests: water being drawn out is a reference to the never-ending spiritual well (Jesus)
- Jesus is the fulfillment of ceremonial washing (the new wine replacing the old)
- Jesus reveals his glory through this miracle
	- Shows creative force in this moment
- Brings life to the party (figuratively and literally
