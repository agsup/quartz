- Multiple answers to the cause of suffering
	- Some suffering is tied to sin (ch. 5), some is not
	- Reason for man's blindness: in order that the works (*plural*) of God may be seen through it
- Why did Jesus choose to use mud?
	- Mirrors what God did to make humans (shapes/fashions mud)
	- ESV translates application of mud as "anointed"
		- Jesus is sharing his "chosenness" by anointing the man with mud
