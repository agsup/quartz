# The Incarnation

- 1:14 dwelling = *skeneoo*, to fix one's tabernacle
- Glory = *doxa* (root prefix for *doxology*), Presence of God, crucifixion
- One and only, monogeneous, single of its kind ("only begotten")
- JB: He who comes after me has surpassed me
	- Jewish: older > younger
	- JB is saying the opposite, which would have confused his audience
- Mosaic Law
	- The law came through Moses
	- Jews love the law (Torah)
	- Grace and truth came through Jesus
