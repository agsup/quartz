# Mary's Act

- Personal involvement
	- Top of her head to the bottom of his feet. Represents total submission
	- Great expense. Possibly her dowry
		- Women paid to be married in her setting
		- Symbolizes Mary giving her life to Jesus in gratitude

# Judas

- Greedily takes from the bag
- Words have the putrid smell of selfishness
- "Fake spirituality"

# Parallels

- Mary broke the jar (Mark)
- Other disciples also rebuke her
- Jesus says "she did what she could"
- Jesus foretells that Mary will be remembered

# Political Landscape

- Passover: independence day
- Still under Roman rule
- 1 week before the crucifixion
- Crowds are "bursting with faith"
- People are expecting to be saved (from Rome) through Jesus
	- Kings rode on horses to represent strength and war
	- Jesus rides on a donkey to represent peace and innocence

# Greeks Seeking Jesus

- God-fearers: Greek admirers of the Jews who acknowledge God, but are not completely converted
