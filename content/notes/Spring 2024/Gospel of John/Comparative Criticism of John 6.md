- Assumes that the HS guided John in his selection of words and events for a reason
- Examines the text of John and notes what elements are unique

# Unique elements in John

- 6:2 "saw the miraculous signs"
- 6:3 crowds are backdrop (went to the kill with his disciples)
- 6:5 testing Philip
- 6:7-9 Names (and the boy)
- 6:10-11 Plenty (as much as they wanted), *men* sat down
	- Note: modern NIV changes to people, but the emphasis is that the men were trying to get the bread first, and Jesus meant to prevent it
- 6:12 "Filled" (not satisfied)
- 6:14 Saw the sign, must be a prophet
- 6:15 Jesus knew they wanted to make him king, he withdrew

# Reasons for telling the story this way

- Crowds followed for signs alone
- Focus is on testing disciples
- Crowd is an opportunity for God to provide
- Names
- Nothing can satisfy but God's spirit
