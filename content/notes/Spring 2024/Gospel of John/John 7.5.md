# The Woman Caught in Adultery

- This story often has a header that states that it was
- not in the original manuscript
- Does not stylistically match John
- Still believed to be an authentic story of Jesus
- Found in other manuscripts with little variation (but the variations are important)
	- Still not sure where it should be placed in the Gospels (manuscripts vary)
	- Some are unsure of *if* it should be placed in the Gospels (old manuscripts lack this story)
- Did the event actually happen?
	- Attested to by Syrian writers of the 3rd century
	- Similar to other traps set by Jesus
	- Consistent with Jesus' characters
- Daggett's Conclusion: Certain of the story's legitimacy, but not its location in the Gospels
	- Text reads smoothly either way
- Why bring her to Jesus?
	- Trap: If stoned, accused before Romans. If spared, inconsistent with Mosaic law
		- "Trapped between Moses and His mercy..."
		- "Trapped between Moses and Mary???"
			- Deut 22:22: both the man and the woman in adultery must die (not necessarily by stoning)
			- Man's not there
			- Stoning is specifically for a virgin pledged to be married who committed adultery (just like Mary)
