title: John 7
---
- Jesus' Brothers
	- Growing up with Jesus had its challenges
	- Felt contempt towards Jesus for being "better"
	- Didn't believe in his divinity
	- Their suggestion is out of sarcasm/malice
	- Believed he was insane
	- Only believed in his divinity after he was resurrected
- Did Jesus lie about not going to the festival?
	- "this" feast vs. "that kind of a" feast
	- Not going in the way that they think he will
- "Feast of the Tabernacles"
	- Remembering the wilderness wanderings
	- Jewish Thanksgiving
	- Prayer for future rain
	- Foreshadowed the flowing of water from Jerusalem into other nations (through Jesus)
