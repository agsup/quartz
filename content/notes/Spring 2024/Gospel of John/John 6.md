# Why was Jesus being followed?

- They saw the signs and "believed" (Jesus was not impressed by this shallow faith)
	- The word "saw" appears in many places in chapter 5
	- This "sensational" can be an addictive "drug" of spirituality
	- We seek what God can do rather than God Himself

# Did the Apostles have any money?

- Eight months wages = 200 denarii = ~$20,000
- Judas kept the money bag (learned in ch. 12)

# How Jesus trains his disciples

- Jesus puts them in a difficult situation (tells them to give people something to eat out of their own hand)
- After they've done what they can, Jesus gives the increase

# Jesus' Character

- Calm in a crowd
- Confident in the face of great need
- Trains and tests
- Resourceful
- Thankful
- Doesn't waste

# What does this sign say about Jesus?

- Jesus is our spiritual bread, which has come down from heaven
- No task is too big if our efforts are multiplied by his power
- God given gifts are not to be wasted
- Little is much in Jesus' hands

# What did the disciples learn from "rough waters"?

- Jesus forced his disciples to leave
- Without Jesus, they made little headway
	- Rode all night long, only made it 3 or 4 miles
	- Immediately reached the shore when Jesus boarded (v. 21)
- Jesus always comes in the morning (3rd watch: 3-6:00 AM)

# In Search of Jesus or Free Lunch?

- Found Jesus in the synagogue, wanted more free bread
	- Hadn't seen the sign, just the miracle
- What is the work that God desires?
	- To believe in the one he had sent (v 29)
- People misunderstood
	- Jesus was not going to give manna, he is the manna
- "Eating my flesh and drinking my blood"
	- Not literal, but Spirit
-
