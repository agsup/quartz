# "Easter Eggs" in John

- "In the beginning..." Clear reference to Genesis 1:1
- John 1-2 counted six days (excludes 7th day, in which God rests)
- Internal evidence of authorship
	- John never identifies himself
	- Hints:
		- Hebrew origin
		- Quotes OT
		- Knowledge of Jewish feasts/customs
		- Knowledge of Jewish and Samaritan rivalry
		- Intimate knowledge of Palestinian topography/temples
		- An eyewitness to the events told
		- Identifies as...
			- The disciple whom Jesus loved
			- The other apostle
# External Evidence

- "We know his testimony is true" (Elders at Ephesus)
- Irenaeus (disciple of Polycarp) against heresies, believed John

# Date?

- Temple destroyed?
	- John discusses the temple
	- Jesus' "rebuilding the temple in 3 days" discussion happened in 26 AD

# How John Begins

- Starts identically to Gen 1:1
- Giver of eternal life is himself eternal
- Over both new and old creation
- Spiritually no one can be reborn/given new life without Him
- Jesus is called *logos* ("The Word")
	- To the Greek: Reason/Thought within
	- To the Hebrew: The words God used to speak the world/law into being
- Images (through symbolism/text) Used:
	- Creative force
	- The Light (*phos*)
	- The Life
- Literary form
	- Lots of repetition
	- Chiasmus: A palindromic statement
		- Statement A
		- Statement B
		- Statement C
		- Restates B
		- Restates A
	- Parallelism: Restating the previous thought in a different way
		- ex. Through Him all was made, without Him nothing was made
	- Spiral Progression: elaborating on previous statements
		- ex. A is true, because A there is B, because B there is C, etc.
- Role of John B?
	- Disputed by some
	- Generally accepted as a prophet by Jews
	- An important witness to introduce Jesus
- What's special about these words?
