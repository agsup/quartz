title: John 11
---
- John writes this *excitedly*
	- You can tell because he breaks into present tense, indicating that he is reliving the moment
- "Jesus loved Lazarus, Martha, and Martha's sister"?
	- John "downplays" Mary? Possibly
- Lazarus called "friend"
	- Jesus' friend = our friend
- Emphasis
	- Contrast between fear of the disciples and Jesus' faith
	- Thomas' willingness to risk it all
	- Ominous language (Judea: the center of everything that hates Jesus)
	- Groupings of three:
		- Love
		- "If only..."
		- Misunderstandings/irony
		- Deeply moved
- Bookends
	- Glory of God
- Reactions of Mary and Martha (waiting until called vs confronting)
- Relationship of Jesus with the siblings (and with others)
	- Mary would later anoint Jesus
	- He loved them
		- Shows that Jesus had special, *unique* connections with people (different from "choosing favorites")
	- Deeply connected with them (felt deep empathy for them)
	- Even Jesus' worst enemies noted his love towards others
- The microcosm of pain and suffering
	- Jesus is capable ("if you had been here...")
	- Jesus cares
	- Jesus feels with us, present in our suffering
	- Jesus works everything out for the good
