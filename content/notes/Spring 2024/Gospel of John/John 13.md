title: John 13
---


- Jesus shows that he has authority of his own life, and will lay it down voluntarily
- Jesus clarifies that washing feet isn't the limit to how far his love goes
- Jesus' robe is symbolic of his life
	- Jesus taking off his robe (putting it down voluntarily)
	- Jesus does a selfless deed (washing feet/being crucified)
	- Jesus puts his robe back on (resurrection)
- How did Jesus' understanding of his identity allow him to wash feet?
	- His hour had come (v. 1)
	- Positioning (Godly nature) (v. 3)
	- Servant leadership
- Full extent
	- "loved them to the last"
	- Gave his life
	- Humbled himself as a servant
	- Greater love has no one than this, to give his life for another
- Why does Peter refuse?
	- Feels unworthy/awkward
	- Thought it was wrong
	- If symbolic of salvation, we can't save ourselves.
- Meaning of "washing each others' feet"
	- Caring for each other
	- Helping each other to get out of sin
	- Rule of thumb: if you enjoy helping too much, it may be a sign of arrogance
	- Best way to help humbly is to acknowledge your emotions ("I have a concern..." or "I have this feeling...")
- Jesus' lesson through this act
	- "Now that I, your Lord and Teacher..."
		- Jesus is Lord first, then a Teacher
	- If the greater serves the lesser, than the lesser should be much more willing to serve each other
	- Calling Jesus "Lord" is one thing, but doing what he says is another
- Why does Jesus warn of the upcoming betrayal?
	- To transform a potentially demoralizing and harmful deed into a cause for faith
	- Jesus had already warned them earlier
	- Jesus washed the feet of a man who would betray him
		- He does this not because Judas is good, but because Jesus is good
- Why is "love one another" a "new" commandment?
	- Context: new in purpose
	- New in quantity
	- Second of three signs of disciplehood (these will be on the next exam)
