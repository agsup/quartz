# The Cross

- The Crown of Thorns
	- Long thorns, long enough to pierce all the way to the skull
	- Symbolizes how Jesus is simultaneously exalted (given a crown), and despised (thorns beaten into his head repeatedly)
- Notes on Pilate
	- Says that he was "more afraid" upon hearing that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, implying that he was afraid in the first place
		- Mostly fearful because of his wife's dreams about the matter
		- Realized the weight of his verdict
	- Begs Jesus to defend himself
- Pains suffered by Jesus
	- Flogging
		- Whip with multiple ends, all with sharp objects on the end (glass, bone, pottery shards, etc.)
		- Made to rip out chunks of flesh
	- Crown of Thorns
		- The phrase "placed upon" is meant to imply force (executed badly by translators, in my opinion)
	- False worship, purple robe
	- Struck on the face
	- Belittled ("Here is the man")
- Why no response?
	- God's will, Jesus is meant to die here, therefore he does not retort
- We are called to follow Jesus' example, especially in unfair treatment. Trust in God
- "IF you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar"
	- Basically a threat to subvert *Pax Romana* if they don't get what they want, which would result in Pilate's termination
-  "We have no King but Caesar"
	- Supreme blasphemy
	- So insanely vehement towards Jesus that they see it as fitting to get away with crucifying Jesus
- Who carried the cross?
	- "own cross" (but what about Simon the Cyrene?)
	- Meant that Jesus picked up the cross, though factually his human form gave way before reaching the post
- King of the Jews, in Greek, Latin, and Aramaic
	- John says "Hebrew" like we say "English"
		- A bajillion different dialects of each
	- Only John includes the languages written in 
	- Note: modern translations are not literal to the original text, which says "Hebrew" (modern translations often say "Aramaic")
- Post-Death
	- Soldiers are mentioned because they are witness to the death of Jesus
	- Jesus ends his life with his only possession being his clothes
- What did Jesus see?
	1. His body
	2. His mother (likely crying inconsolably)
	3. The disciple whom he loved (John)
- Mary's deeds
	- Made his clothes, which were gambled away
	- Risked her life, took on shame (virgin birth)
	- Cared deeply for him
- Who did Jesus care for?
	- His mother
	- John (gave John the mission of caring for his mother)
- Women at the cross
	- Mary (mother of Jesus)
	- Mary (wife of Clopas)
	- Salome
	- Mary Magdalene
- All the male disciples are in hiding
- Why give Mary to John?
	- Jesus' brothers didn't believe (until after the resurrection)
	- Close relative/best friend?
	- "Mother of the church"? (think RomCaths)
- Sayings from the cross
	1. "I'm thirsty"
		- Extended life just long enough to die at the same time as the first set of Passover lambs
	1. "It is finished"
		- Fulfillment of Scripture
		- All was now completed
		- Debt of sin is paid
		- Point of connection made
- Significance of testimony
	- Not exaggerated legend
	- Eyewitness account of Jesus' death
	- Prophesies fulfilled in detail
- Nicodemus and Joseph`
	- Faced Pilate
	- Claimed Jesus
	- Honored him as King
		- Gave immense amounts of spices, equal to that of King Asa (nearly 100 years wages)
- Nicodemus' Faith
