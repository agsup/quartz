- What are some reasons j=Jesus gives us to be comforted?
	- Plenty of rooms (this is where "mansion" imagery comes from)
	- A place will be prepared
	- The way will be known
- Exclusive Claims of Jesus
	- "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (v. 6)
- Relationship between Jesus and the Father
	- Jesus is the mirror image of God ("If you've seen me...")
	- The Father is in Him
	- Jesus came to replicate himself (through his followers)
- Why believe these claims?
	- His words are not just His own, but the Father's, living in Him
	- His works are a "backup" reason
- Why must He leave?
	- After leaving Jesus will enable greater things via the Holy Spirit
- Love and Obedience
	- "If you love me, you will obey what I command" (v. 15)
	- "Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me..." (v. 21)
- What will be the work of the HS
	- Counselor (Paraklete: One who is called to another's side)
	- He will always be with us
	- He will teach the Apostles all things (v. 26)
