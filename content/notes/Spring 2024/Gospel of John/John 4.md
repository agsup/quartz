title: John 4
---


- Jesus was making disciples and baptizing
- "Had" to go through Samaria
	- Not geographically or socially, but theologically necessary
	- A Samaritan to meet, racism to defeat
- Second connection with Jacob. Well is first called a "spring" referring to "living water"
- Joseph story would recall? Jealousy, God's plan prevails?
- Woman "draws" water, ties in with 2:7
- "<u>In Spirit</u> and in truth", same as 3:5
- Jacob's Well
	- Living water: a fountain or spring (flowing)
- What do we know about the woman
	- Married 5 times (probably shameful)
	- Afraid of people
		- Draws water at noon, separately from others
		- Passed a well in town to get to this one
	- Evasive or religiously curious
		- "So you're a prophet then"
	- Evangelistic
		- Runs to the townspeople she previously feared to share the news of the Messiah
- Ways Jesus treats the woman
	- Blunt, direct
		- Note: this was considered a virtue to Jews
	- Not condescending
	- Breaks taboo to have a conversation with her
		- A woman, who is also a Samaritan, who is also immoral
	- Accepting
- Living water?
	- The Holy Spirit (7:38-39)
	- Bad history between Jews and Samaritans
	- What was the woman's preconceived notion of the Messiah?
		- He will explain everything
- "In Spirit and in truth"
	- Heart (passion) and mind (Scriptural/logical)?
	- Alternative: Spirit and truth in contrast to temple and tradition
- What opportunity were the disciples about to miss?
	- Souls not Samaritans (ready believers)
	- Racism may have blinded them (filthy, inhospitable Samaritans)
- Evolution of Samaritans' faith?
	- At first they took the woman at her word, but eventually grew to believe Jesus from his own words (4:42)
- Nobleman
	- Jesus heals the child remotely, nobleman is relieved and not rushing to get back (gets there a day later)
	- Because of his faith, the child was healed as soon as Jesus said he would be
