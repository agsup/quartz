## Prelude

- Church started on Pentecost (50 days after Passover)
- Church was influenced primarily by Jewish culture
- Levites were initially assigned as the chorus/band to sing the songs of praise
	- This was Pre-Babylon, far before Jesus
- Synagogues
	- Places of worship, not just study
	- Invented during Babylonian exile
	- Exist all over the world for Jewish worship
- Instruments were used in Jewish worship, but not in the synagogue (reason unknown)
	- Side-note, *a cappella* means "in the style of the chapel"
- Points of focus in early Christian worship
	- Fellowship (breaking bread)
	- Communion (also called breaking bread)
	- Read Scripture
	- Pray
	- Listen to a sermon (Exhortation)
- Potential reasons for unaccompanied singing
	- Discreetness (during times of persecution)
	- Courtesy (noise levels)
	- Monetary
	- Expertise
	- Instruments associated with Pagan practice
	- Text was more important than the music
- Details about the music
	- Monophonic/limited harmony
	- No notation
	- Often had heavy ornamentation on longer syllables
	- Most often sung by a cantor, sometimes by a group
	- Mostly in Hebrew, but probably switched to Greek around the time of Paul's missionary journey
- Music in the Graeco-Roman World
	- Music was seen as magical
	- Doctrine of Ethos
		- Music that you listen to has an effect on your life's outcome (Plato/Aristotle)
		- Specific keys/chords could affect mood (in more specific ways than we think of today)
	- Intoning important texts
		- Intoning: speaking/singing in a specific "sacred" pitch or range of pitches to give reverence to a text
		- Both Greeks and Christians did this
		- Still done today in synagogue
