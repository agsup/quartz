## Prelude

- Church started on Pentecost (50 days after Passover)
- Church was influenced primarily by Jewish culture
- Levites were initially assigned as the chorus/band to sing the songs of praise
	- This was Pre-Babylon, far before Jesus
- Synagogues
	- Places of worship, not just study
	- Invented during Babylonian exile
	- Exist all over the world for Jewish worship
- Instruments were used in Jewish worship, but not in the synagogue (reason unknown)
	- Side-note, *a cappella* means "in the style of the chapel"
- Points of focus in early Christian worship
	- Fellowship (breaking bread)
	- Communion (also called breaking bread)
	- Read Scripture
	- Pray
	- Listen to a sermon (Exhortation)
- Potential reasons for unaccompanied singing
	- Discreetness (during times of persecution)
	- Courtesy (noise levels)
	- Monetary
	- Expertise
	- Instruments associated with Pagan practice
	- Text was more important than the music
- Details about the music
	- Monophonic/limited harmony
	- No notation
	- Often had heavy ornamentation on longer syllables
	- Most often sung by a cantor, sometimes by a group
	- Mostly in Hebrew, but probably switched to Greek around the time of Paul's missionary journey
### Music in the Graeco-Roman World

- Music was seen as magical
- Doctrine of Ethos
	- Music that you listen to has an effect on your life's outcome (Plato/Aristotle)
	- Specific keys/chords could affect mood (in more specific ways than we think of today)
- Intoning important texts
	- Intoning: speaking/singing in a specific "sacred" pitch or range of pitches to give reverence to a text
	- Both Greeks and Christians did this
	- Still done today in synagogue
- Singing In Early Christian Worship
- Hazzan/Cantor
	- Call and Response
- Poetic Devices in Hebrew Poetry
	- Synonymous parallelism
		- Ex. "break them with a rod of iron, shatter them like earthenware"
	- Antithetical parallelism
		- Ex. "The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish"
- Included the Psalms (Jewish chants)
- First century culture expected the texts to be sung, not spoken
- Most early hymns are focused on Jesus' majesty/lordship
- ***Hymnos*** (Greek): words of praise intended to be sung in honor of a deity
	- *Note: Will almost definitely be on a test!!!*
- Vocal, not instrumental
- Monophonic
- No common repertoire from place to place
- May have been solo or congregational (conjecture)
- Singing was not the focus
- Core Elements of Early Christian Worship
	- Fellowship
	- Communion
	- Teaching 
	- Prayer
	- Edification
	- Encouragement
- Singing is used as a form of admonishment
- ***Canticle***: Song from scripture, apart from the psalms and quotations (ex. Magnificat)
- As time progressed, the Church became less Jewish and more Greek
- ***Clement of Alexandria***: A church father, wrote hymns
- **Candle-lighting Hymn** (*Phos Hilaron*, "Joyful Light"): very old hymn, one of the first
	- Note: this is a Trinitarian hymn, which was (and still is) an issue of great contention
- ***Oxyrhynchus Hymn***: The oldest discovered manuscript of a Christian hymn
	- Pieces are missing, and there are many interpretations trying to fill in gaps/read the Greek notation system
- ***Odes to Solomon***: early collection of hymns
	- Called one of the earliest Christian hymnals
	- Not actually written by Solomon
	- Not even of Hebrew origin
	- Likely of Syrian origin
	- Rooted in gnosticism (*Gnosis*: knowledge), so didn't gain traction
### Summary of Early Greek Psalms

1. Most were hymns ("hymnos") by the strictest definition (songs of praise or "worship") from the word "proskuneo" (to kiss forward, to prostrate oneself before)
2. They contain colorful, descriptive metaphors that were sung in short, very direct phrases (Dr. Ganus: "popcorn" phrases)
3. Simple melodies with syllabic musical declamation

### Legalization and Establishment

- Leaders of the early Church
	- Bishop: "overseer"
	- Elder
	- Pastor: "shepherd"
