## Prelude

- Church started on Pentecost (50 days after Passover)
- Church was influenced primarily by Jewish culture
- Levites were initially assigned as the chorus/band to sing the songs of praise
	- This was Pre-Babylon, far before Jesus
- Synagogues
	- Places of worship, not just study
	- Invented during Babylonian exile
	- Exist all over the world for Jewish worship
- Instruments were used in Jewish worship, but not in the synagogue (reason unknown)
	- Side-note, *a cappella* means "in the style of the chapel"
- Points of focus in early Christian worship
	- Fellowship (breaking bread)
	- Communion (also called breaking bread)
	- Read Scripture
	- Pray
	- Listen to a sermon (Exhortation)
- Potential reasons for unaccompanied singing
	- Discreetness (during times of persecution)
	- Courtesy (noise levels)
	- Monetary
	- Expertise
	- Instruments associated with Pagan practice
	- Text was more important than the music
- Details about the music
	- Monophonic/limited harmony
	- No notation
	- Often had heavy ornamentation on longer syllables
	- Most often sung by a cantor, sometimes by a group
	- Mostly in Hebrew, but probably switched to Greek around the time of Paul's missionary journey

## Music in the Graeco-Roman World

- Music was seen as magical
- Doctrine of Ethos
	- Music that you listen to has an effect on your life's outcome (Plato/Aristotle)
	- Specific keys/chords could affect mood (in more specific ways than we think of today)
- Intoning important texts
	- Intoning: speaking/singing in a specific "sacred" pitch or range of pitches to give reverence to a text
	- Both Greeks and Christians did this
	- Still done today in synagogue
- Singing In Early Christian Worship
- Hazzan/Cantor
	- Call and Response
- Poetic Devices in Hebrew Poetry
	- Synonymous parallelism
		- Ex. "break them with a rod of iron, shatter them like earthenware"
	- Antithetical parallelism
		- Ex. "The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish"
- Included the Psalms (Jewish chants)
- First century culture expected the texts to be sung, not spoken
- Most early hymns are focused on Jesus' majesty/lordship
- ***Hymnos*** (Greek): words of praise intended to be sung in honor of a deity
	- *Note: Will almost definitely be on a test!!!*
- Vocal, not instrumental
- Monophonic
- No common repertoire from place to place
- May have been solo or congregational (conjecture)
- Singing was not the focus
- Core Elements of Early Christian Worship
	- Fellowship
	- Communion
	- Teaching 
	- Prayer
	- Edification
	- Encouragement
- Singing is used as a form of admonishment
- ***Canticle***: Song from scripture, apart from the psalms and quotations (ex. Magnificat)
- As time progressed, the Church became less Jewish and more Greek
- ***Clement of Alexandria***: A church father, wrote hymns
- **Candle-lighting Hymn** (*Phos Hilaron*, "Joyful Light"): very old hymn, one of the first
	- Note: this is a Trinitarian hymn, which was (and still is) an issue of great contention
- ***Oxyrhynchus Hymn***: The oldest discovered manuscript of a Christian hymn
	- Pieces are missing, and there are many interpretations trying to fill in gaps/read the Greek notation system
- ***Odes to Solomon***: early collection of hymns
	- Called one of the earliest Christian hymnals
	- Not actually written by Solomon
	- Not even of Hebrew origin
	- Likely of Syrian origin
	- Rooted in gnosticism (*Gnosis*: knowledge), so didn't gain traction

## Summary of Early Greek Psalms

1. Most were hymns ("hymnos") by the strictest definition (songs of praise or "worship") from the word "proskuneo" (to kiss forward, to prostrate oneself before)
2. They contain colorful, descriptive metaphors that were sung in short, very direct phrases (Dr. Ganus: "popcorn" phrases)
3. Simple melodies with syllabic musical declamation

## Legalization and Establishment

- 2nd and 3rd century church
	- Centralization of power
	- Growing persecution from Rome
- Leaders of the early Church
	- Bishop: "overseer"
	- Elder: self-explanatory, interchangeable with bishop
	- Pastor: "shepherd"
- 2nd and 3rd century consolidation of power
	- Individual bishops claimed sole authority over certain regions
	- The congregations in that region followed the practices and mandates of the head bishop
	- By the end of the 3rd century, congregations began to meet in dedicated buildings rather than in houses
- Reasons for persecution of Christians by Romans
	- Certain leadership (ex. Nero)
	- Did not exalt Caesar as "lord"
	- Did not participate in state sanctioned rites
	- Worshipped in homes
- Periods of persecution
	- Nero
		- Blamed Christians for the great fire of Rome in 64 A.D
		- Executed Paul and Peter
	- Domitian
		- Might have exiled John to Patmos
		- Possibly responsible for more widespread persecution, but this is disputed
	- Diocletian
		- Responsible for the "Great Persecution"
		- Forced subjects to worship the Emperor
		- Many died, others fled
		- Many fled to a mountain and found refuge in *[San Marino](https://www.google.com/search?q=san+marino&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjj8NHm2ZGBAxWzJN4AHbOcBscQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=san+marino&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMggIABCABBCxAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BAgjECc6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOgcIABCKBRBDOggIABCxAxCDAToKCAAQigUQsQMQQ1CHBViKDGDaDWgAcAB4AIABTogB9gWSAQIxMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=gDH2ZOOwFLPJ-LYPs7mauAw&bih=857&biw=1485&client=firefox-b-1-d)*
- Legalization of Christianity under Constantine
	- Won a battle under the name of Christ, issued the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity
	- Returned Christian property and made Sunday a day of worship
	- Mother (Helena) was Christian, had Constantine build large [basilicas](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=562581159&channel=fenc&sxsrf=AB5stBhNcR0UVmiGWX23QQl7WQ02D1N4yQ:1693856125731&q=basilica&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjl3rHl2ZGBAxV7lWoFHV3wC0kQ0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1485&bih=857&dpr=1.5) over holy sites
	- Likely won the favor of Christians for political reasons (as well as for his mother)
	- Council of Nicaea
		- Addressed the problem of Arius of Alexandria
		- Arius taught that the trinity was not equal parts, but that there was a hierarchy
		- Arius was refuted, but they were unable to eliminate the heresy
		- The [Goths of Italy](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fenc&client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Goths+of+Italy) were fond of Arian theology
		- Arians produced a large number of their own hymns
		- Date of Easter established
		- Issued the [Creed of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_versions_of_the_Nicene_Creed) (their list of beliefs)
		- The conflict with gnostic heresies caused distrust in "human-composed" hymns
			- Many advocated for only singing straight from Scripture
	- Ottomans invaded in 1453, ending the Eastern Roman Empire (Constantinople was the capital all the way up until then)
	- Creed of Constantinople (381 AD)
		- Very similar to the Nicene Creed, but without the anathematization

		- Allowed Christians to re-appropriate pagan temples
		- Insisted on the acceptance of Nicene theology (trinitarianism)
- Christian song of the Byzantines

		- Strong Jewish/Syrian (Antioch) influence
		- Hymns of monophonic, unaccompanied chant
		- Strongly didactic (doctrinal), especially Trinitarian
		- ["Troparion"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troparion): an early type of byzantine hymn, short, of one stanza

### Increasing Power of the Bishop of Rome

- With the Emperor in Constantinople, the Bishop of Rome became more powerful
- By the 6th century, Latin began to replace Greek in the Western Church
- Latin Vulgate replaced Greek Septuagint/NT
- By the 6th century, the Bishop of Rome began to be called "papa" (Pope)
- Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers
	- Brought the Greek style back from Asia minor, with emphasis on the Trinity
- Ambrose, Bishop of Milan
	- Baptized Augustine/gave council to Theodosius
	- Responsible for "When in Rome..."
		- "When in Rome..." actually was church advice, meet people in their culture rather than imposing your own culture (avoid syncretism)
	- Antiphonal songs
- Nicetas of Remesiana, Bishop of Dacia
	- May have authored the ["Te Deum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Deum)
- Augustine, Bishop of Hippo
	- Baptized Ambrose, conflicted about music in the church

### The End of Congregational Singing

- Large churches were built
- Buildings revered as holy places/shrines
- Church hierarchy developed with a single bishop at the top
- Influence or skills were often valued above spiritual qualities
- Ordained priests, "clergy" were put in control of local churches and buildings
- "Laymen" were not allowed to be active in church affairs
- Everything becomes more "professional"
