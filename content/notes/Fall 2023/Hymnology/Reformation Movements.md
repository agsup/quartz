# 800 AD: Charlemagne

- King of the Franks
- Gave the Pope more political power after being crowned "King of the Romans" on Christmas Day, 800 AD
- People he conquered were forced to accept Christianity
- Period of great creativity
- Effects of this on the church:
	- Clerics elaborated on Old Roman Chant (ORC) and wrote new chants
	- Drama with music was added to special church festivals (ex. morality plays)
	- Instruments occasionally added to support vocal lines
	- Originally very practical to bolster the voices, but eventually became more ornamental
	- Experimented with polyphony by adding more parts to ORCs (simultaneous melodies)
		- Earliest experiments were with *organum*, melody is repeated by transposing a fixed distance up or down (normally a fifth)
		- Eventually started messing with drones (*drone organum*)
	- Modern notation started with Guido of Arezzo (taught using the [Guidonian Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidonian_hand))
	- Bernard of Clairvaux
		- Poetry probably inspired "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee", "Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts", and "O Sacred Head"

# 1054

- Schism of 1054
	- Separation of Western and Eastern Christianity (Roman Catholic in the West and Eastern Orthodox)
	- Eastern was much more politically active
	- Had deep effects liturgically as well as doctrinally
	- Also known as "The Great Schism"
- Francis of Assisi
	- Led a "return to simplicity" religious movement ([Franciscan Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans))
	- Wrote some of the first Italian poems
		- Italians wrote almost all poems in Latin, since Latin was the "academic" language
	- Wrote "Canticle of the Sun"
		- "All Creatures of Our God and King" was based on this poem
- ***True Polyphony!!!***
	- Harmony: same rhythm, makes chords
	- True Polyphony: fully independent melodies
- Disputes about polyphonic music
	- Overcomplexity in music overshadowed the words
	-
