# 800 AD: Charlemagne

- King of the Franks
- Gave the Pope more political power after being crowned "King of the Romans" on Christmas Day, 800 AD
- People he conquered were forced to accept Christianity
- Period of great creativity
- Effects of this on the church:
	- Clerics elaborated on Old Roman Chant (ORC) and wrote new chants
	- Drama with music was added to special church festivals (ex. morality plays)
	- Instruments occasionally added to support vocal lines
	- Originally very practical to bolster the voices, but eventually became more ornamental
	- Experimented with polyphony by adding more parts to ORCs (simultaneous melodies)
		- Earliest experiments were with *organum*, melody is repeated by transposing a fixed distance up or down (normally a fifth)
		- Eventually started messing with drones (*drone organum*)
	- Modern notation started with Guido of Arezzo (taught using the [Guidonian Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidonian_hand))
	- Bernard of Clairvaux
		- Poetry probably inspired "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee", "Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts", and "O Sacred Head"

# 1054

- Schism of 1054
	- Separation of Western and Eastern Christianity (Roman Catholic in the West and Eastern Orthodox)
	- Eastern was much more politically active
	- Had deep effects liturgically as well as doctrinally
	- Also known as "The Great Schism"
- Francis of Assisi
	- Led a "return to simplicity" religious movement ([Franciscan Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans))
	- Wrote some of the first Italian poems
		- Italians wrote almost all poems in Latin, since Latin was the "academic" language
	- Wrote "Canticle of the Sun"
		- "All Creatures of Our God and King" was based on this poem
- ***True Polyphony!!!***
	- Harmony: same rhythm, makes chords
	- True Polyphony: fully independent melodies
- Disputes about polyphonic music
	- Overcomplexity in music overshadowed the words
		- Some chants were also mixed with others, making the individual chants hard to discern
- Around the time of the Renaissance, there was growing dissatisfaction with the church's doctrine
	- Wealth accumulated (and kept) by the church
	- Indulgences (pay up to absolve your sin)
	- Celibacy of the priesthood
	- Worship in Latin rather than the common language
	- Unspiritual music and complexity for complexity's sake
	- etc.
- John Wycliffe
	- Translated the Bible into English
	- Translated into English
	- Led the "Lollard" movement
		- Once was an insult, they appropriated the title
	- Was declared a heretic after his death
- Jan Hus
	- Admired Wycliffe
	- Didn't like indulgences
	- Promised safe passage to defend his ideas
		- This was a lie, they burned him at the stake
		- The Roman church absolutely sucked.
	- Hussites
		- Loved singing hymns, Hus wrote a number of them
		- Sometimes known as the "Bohemian Brethren" or "Unity of Brethren" (*Unitas Fratum*)
		- Many of these hymns were adopted by German-speaking people in other movements
		- Known for:
			- simple worship
			- Reverence of the Eucharist (with everyone taking the body and the blood instead of just the body)
			- Reverence of Scripture
			- Songs about persecution, perseverance, and unity
			- They fled to other parts of Europe while persecuted, including Moravia (Modern Czech Rep.)
- Martin Luther
	- Catholic priest, professor of Theology
	- Pope Leo X authorized the Archbishop of Mainz to sell indulgences to rebuild St. Peter's basilica in Rome (seen as the most important church in Rome)
	- Johann Tetzel was in charge of indulgences in German
		- "When a coin in the coffer rings, a soul from Purgatory springs"
	- 95 Theses
		- Allegedly posted on the door of the All Saints Church in Wittenberg
		- Excommunicated by the Pope in 1521, called to appear before the Diet of Worms (gen. assembly of the HRE)
		- "I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen."
		- Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony had Luther "kidnapped" by "robbers" on his way home to be taken into "custody" in a castle for a year
		- Translated the Bible from Latin to German
- Frederick the Wise
	- Charged admission to see over 19,000 relics
	- A person would gain an indulgence of 1,902,202 years and 270 days reduction in their purgatory sentence just for viewing the relics
	- Very surprising for him to agree with Luther
