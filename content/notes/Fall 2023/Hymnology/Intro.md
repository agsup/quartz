## More Introductory Terms and Information

- How are Hymns Named?
	- Often from the first words of the refrain (ex. "Shine Jesus Shine")
	- Occasionally the first words of the first verse (ex. "God Moves in a Mysterious Way")
- Why do some poems have multiple musical pieces attached with them?
	- **Common Tune**: Tune is used with many different texts (ex. Brahm's Lullaby)
	- **Proper Tune**: this *has* to be with this tune (ex. Joy to the World)
- **Poetic Meter**: Pattern of syllables in a line of text
- **Verse**: a single line of poetry
- **Stanza/Strophe**: a grouping of poetic lines
- **Refrain**: A line of poetry repeated after every stanza
- **Chorus**: Similar to a refrain, more detachable (often added by another poet/musician)
	- Ex. "Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed?"
		- The chorus is notably differing in style from the stanzas
- **Hymnic Meter**: The pattern of accented and unaccented syllables in a line of text.
	- Amazing Grace is 8,6,8,6, which is referred to as "common meter"
	- Long Meter: 8,8,8,8
	- Short Meter: 6,6,8,6
	- This metering count excludes refrains/choruses
	- Example of common meter:

| 1    | 2     | 3    | 4      | 5    | 6     | 7   | 8     |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| A    | ma    | zing | grace  | how  | sweet | the | sound |
| That | saved | a    | wretch | like | me    |     |       |
| I    | once  | was  | lost   | but  | now   | am  | found |
| Was  | blind | but  | now    | I    | see   |     |       |

- **Strophic**: no refrain, only strophes, music repeats
	- Various rhyme schemes (AABB, ABAB, ABCB, etc.)
	- AABB is good for hymns with many syllable per line
