# 800 AD: Charlemagne

- King of the Franks
- Gave the Pope more political power after being crowned "King of the Romans" on Christmas Day, 800 AD
- People he conquered were forced to accept Christianity
- Period of great creativity
- Effects of this on the church:
	- Clerics elaborated on Old Roman Chant (ORC) and wrote new chants
	- Drama with music was added to special church festivals (ex. morality plays)
	- Instruments occasionally added to support vocal lines
	- Originally very practical to bolster the voices, but eventually became more ornamental
	- Experimented with polyphony by adding more parts to ORCs (simultaneous melodies)
		- Earliest experiments were with *organum*, melody is repeated by transposing a fixed distance up or down (normally a fifth)
		- Eventually started messing with drones (*drone organum*)
	- Modern notation started with Guido of Arezzo (taught using the [Guidonian Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidonian_hand))
	- Bernard of Clairvaux
