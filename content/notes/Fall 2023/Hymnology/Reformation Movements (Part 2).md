		- Believed God gave us everything we need in the Bible alone
- [Apostle's Creed](https://www.learnreligions.com/five-point-calvinism-700356) was introduced
- Clement Marot
	- Favorite poet of Francis I of France
	- 1542: Marot published 30 psalms in french verse which were very popular with the Huguenots
	- Because of this indirect association, he was exiled from France, despite not being Huguenot himself
	- Moved to Geneva and continued to versify the psalms in French (completed 49 psalms)
- [St. Bartholomew's Day Massacres](https://www.worldhistory.org/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_Massacre/) (death of many Huguenots)
- Theodore Beza
	- Calvin commissioned him first to finish a Psalter
	- The complete Geneva Psalter was published in 1562
	- Most tunes collected from other sources or written by [Louis Bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bourgeois_(composer))
- Geneva Psalter
	- Monophonic and unaccompanied music
	- Simple and Syllabic, only short/long rhythmic values
	- Mostly step-wise motion
	- Had a lilt because of this pattern, Q. Elizabeth I called them "Genevan Jigs"

	- 125 tunes and texts in 110 meters (many meters were specific to certain Psalms)
		- ex. Psalm 42 was 8-7-8-7-7-7-8-8
- Aftermath
	- Some followers began to sing spiritual songs with 4 to 5 parts at home
	- Calvin and Bourgeois had a falling out, as Bourgeois wanted to have 4 part harmony and instruments in worship
