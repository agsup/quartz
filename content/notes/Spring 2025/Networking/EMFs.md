- Larger waves = wider reach (ex.radio)
- Higher frequency = faster rates (ex. Microwaves for LAN/3G/4G)
	- Too high and you get cancer (ex. xrays)
- ISM bands: unlicensed bands set aside for industrial, scientific, or medical purposes
	- Wifi and Bluetooth operate in these bands

## Radio transmission

- Can penetrate buildings/walls
- Higher frequency radio bands can bounce off of the ionosphere
- Ground waves in lower frequency bands follow the curvature of the Earth

## Michaelwaves

- Signal is reflected by most everyday objects
- Strength varies with mobility

## Satellites

- Types
	- GEO (geostationary)
		- orbital lock with the earth
	- MEO (medium earth orbit)
		- Below the Upper Van Allen belt (above the Lower Van Allen belt)
	- LEO (low earth orbit)
		- Below the Lower Van Allen belt
- The higher the satellite, the higher the latency, but less satellites required for global coverage
