- To do: try to find assets
- Work on scene flow
- Justifications for themed game mechanics
	- Butter: food can slide on buttered tiles, not unbuttered ones
		- For sliding, pick up staying stack with spatula, slide lower ones?
		- Maybe more practical to say pieces that stay on the bottom "cook through" while higher pieces don't cook through (more cooked pieces win)
		- If all pieces are cooked through, consecutive pieces have "marinated in their juices" and have enhanced flavor?
	- Plated/trashed (win/loss)
	- Long, narrow boards, move to the griddle
	- Burnt slices? If so when? Ask team
- Make sure the rest of the team knows the interface as well (everyone must speak)
- Sell the prototype
- Make a storyboard. You'll need it.
- Every scene needs a screenshot
- Every screen needs only to have a representation (ex. tutorial screen doesn't need to have every slide, it needs only to exist and be interactive)
