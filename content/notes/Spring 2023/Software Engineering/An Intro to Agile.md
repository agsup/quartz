- The Waterfall has many offshoot techniques
	- One is the UP, from that comes Agile, from which comes Scrum
	  
### One Wasatch (Snowbird Ski Resort)

- A group of developers (many of which were from competing companies) got together to formulate ideas on how to make software engineering better
	- Wrote the Manifesto for Agile Software Development
		- 4 values
			1. **Individuals and interactions** over *processes and tools*
			2. **working software** over *comprehensive documentation*
			3. **Customer collaboration** over *contract negotiation*
			4. **Responding to change** over *following a plan*
		- The *italic* is important, but the **bold** is more important
