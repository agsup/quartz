1. Define Software Engineering. A good definition is this one from Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe discipline of software engineering encompasses knowledge, tools, and methods for defining software [requirements](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Requirements "http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Requirements"), and performing [software design](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_design "http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_design"), [software construction](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Computer_programming "http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Computer_programming"), [software testing](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_testing "http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_testing"), and [software maintenance](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_maintenance "http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Software_maintenance") tasks.‚Äù

2. Explain how Software Engineering is different from Computer Science.  
- Diff between engineering and science in general
3. Explain how the skills required for SE are non-stereotypical for CS majors.  
- People skills, communication, teamwork, etc.
4. Which phase of software engineering is most critical, and why?  
- a
5. Why does post-delivery maintenance account for as much as 75% of the total cost of a software system? How does the development process address this?  
- a
6. Why are there no planning, testing, and documentation ‚Äúphases‚Äù in software development?  
- a
7. Give three statistics which were cited in one of our texts to indicate why some would say there is a crisis in software development project success.
- 29% success, 18% canceled, 53% late/over-budget
8. List and describe three different types of maintenance.  
- corrective, adaptive, and perfective
9. What are the advantages of iterative and incremental development?  
- a
10. Describe unusual techniques that are used in agile/extreme development?  
- a
11. How are COTS and open-source projects different from internal and contract projects?  
- Difference in user-base

12. From Code Complete chapters 1-4:

- What is the most challenging part of programming, according to McConnell?
- Explain which of the software construction metaphors given you believe is best, and explain why.
	- Pick from house, oyster (pearls), farming, and letter-writing
- Cite some numerical statistics given by McConnell demonstrating the relative cost of errors, depending on where they are made and where they are discovered in the software development life cycle.
	- Pick three of these figures:
	- Baird recommends the figures of 10 on the top row

- According to McConnell, what percentage of code is often needed just for exception handling?
	- 80-90%
- According to McConnell, what percentage of change in the requirements is to be expected during the development process?
	- 25%
13. Define timeboxing. Define feature creep.  
    
- a
      
14. Who is Jacobsen? What is Rational Software? What do these have to do with software engineering?  
- a
15. Where did the Rational Unified Process get its name? i.e. Where did ‚Äúrational‚Äù and ‚Äúunified‚Äù come from?  

- Rational: Company Name
- Unified: JB&R (Jacobsen from Objectory, Booch from Ericcson, and Rumbaugh of General Electric) all unified their processes for software engineering

16. Explain, in as much detail as possible, the following statement: ‚ÄúThe Unified Process is use-case driven‚Äù.  
    
- Explain the 5 steps (req, analy, design, implem, and test) and how the use-case drives each of them
- Be as wordy as possible

17. How do JB&R define the difference between iteration and incrementation?
    
- Three Unified developers behind RUP, from JBR reading assignment. They define the difference as iteration = steps in workflow, increment = growth in product.

18. Diagram and label these software life cycle models: (note the version from class)  
    
- Waterfall (OOSE fig. 2.9)
- Iterative ‚Äì it will take time to learn this diagram ‚Äì label all the phases, disciplines, and iterations ‚Äì note when each discipline rises and falls. This is the most important one!  
- These are in "brief intro.pdf" on canvas

19. What activities take place during the requirements workflow? Analysis? Design? Implementation?  
- This is not going to be on the test, too detailed (but is in OOSE ch 3 notes)
20. What are the CMM and ISO 9000 standards and what are they trying to address?

- What are they, how are they the same?
- Grading a company's ability in SE
- They are trying to address *the crisis* (the 29% success rate)

21. List three barriers or challenges to requirements elicitation, as discussed in class.
- a
22. List at least five of the standard requirements elicitation techniques which were discussed in class. In other words, what tools to we use to find out what stakeholders need, find out if we have it right and make sure we haven‚Äôt missed anything?  
- a
23. List and briefly describe five different non-functional system requirements,indicating for each one if it is usually more important to the end-user or the developer.  
- a
24. What would be examples of metrics for measuring the quality of the requirements workflow?  
- Not on the test, but 
25. What are some important things to keep in mind when interviewing a stakeholder for the purpose of determining requirements? (Give 5)  

- L/W article
- Three barriers
- Interviewing list ("Chap 10: Interviewing") 

26. What are some important things to keep in mind during a ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù session?  
- a
27. What is the purpose of ‚Äústoryboarding‚Äù and what are three ways to do it?
    
- Borrowed from the film industry
- Layout of a blueprint for a product
- Easily modifiable before committing actual resources to development
- Three ways:

	1. Pencil/Paper Flip-charts
	2. PowerPoint
	3. Prototypes	    
- Note: Lower-tech = more receptive to change
	    

28. Explain Brook‚Äôs law.  
- a
29. What is the difference between a ‚Äúprogram‚Äù and a ‚Äúprogramming systems product‚Äù, as defined by Brooks?  

- The easy way to answer the question is to draw the graph
| prog prod        |                   | prog sys prod | 
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| üîº3x complicated | ‚ÜóÔ∏è                |               |
| prog             | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3x complicated | prog sys      |
- Diff is in complexity and cost (program is simple, prog sys prod is 9x as complicated)

30. What are the pluses and minuses of programming as an activity, according to Brooks? (joys and woes)  
- a
31. Explain why Brooks says to ‚Äúplan to throw one away‚Äù. Your answer needs to be more than ‚Äúyou will anyway‚Äù.  
- a
32. According to Leffingwell and Widrig, what are the three primary causes of project failure? According to Brooks, what is the primary cause?  
- a
33. What is the ‚Äúundiscovered ruins‚Äù syndrome? What is the ‚Äúuser and developer‚Äù syndrome?
- a
