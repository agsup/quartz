## What is it?

- 2<sup>nd</sup> to last phase
- Provides clear, transparent look at the current state of the project
- Allows for input from all Scrum parties

## Prework

- Determine who to invite, what each person is presenting, etc.

## Scheduling

- Of the four scrum activities, review is hardest to schedule
- Invite as many parties as possible (customers, clients, etc.)
- One-hour-per-sprint-week rule

## Confirm Doneness

- Everyone must agree that it's done
- Product Owner's responsibility

***Delegate Responsibility***

## Overview and Summarization

- Often done by the product owner
- Summary of sprint results vs. goal
- Blame-free

## Demonstrate

- Often mislabeled as "demo"
	- "Demo" normally means "no feedback", just exhibition
	- *We want feedback*

## Discuss

- for observation, comments, and reasonable discussion
- Allows for non-scrum members to ask questions

## Adapt

- This phase serves to provide input from stakeholders
- Used to adapt backlog and release plans

## Sprint Review Issues

- Sign-offs (largely unnecessary)
	- Should not be done during/immediately after the review
	- Stakeholder disagreements should be valued
- Sporadic Attendance
	- Can slow you down
- Large Development Efforts
	- Might have to manage multiple parties
