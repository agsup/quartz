## What is the Product Backlog?

- A prioritized list of desired product functionality
	- Heart of the Scrum framework
- Product Backlog Items (PBI)
	- Visualized in a queue data structure
	- Items included are:
		- Features
			- User stories
			- Use cases
			- Free form text
		- Defects
		- Technical Work
		- Knowledge acquisition
- D.E.E.P.
	- Detailed Appropriately
		- "Going to Seattle to learn about React" (:luc_thumbs_up:) vs. "Training" (:luc_thumbs_down:)
	- Emergent
	- Estimated
	- Prioritized
- Grooming the Backlog
	- We must proactively manage, organize, and administer the product backlog
		- What, who and when
	- This can mean many things
		- Might take a slice from the PBI and split it
		- Might delete a slice
		- Might insert items
		- Might re-prioritize
		- etc...
- Definition of "Ready"
	- Business value is clearly articulated
	- Details can be understood by the development team
	- Dependencies are identified
	- Team of staffed appropriately
	- PBI is of reasonable size to be completed in one sprint

	- Performance criteria are defined and testable
	- Scrum team understands how to demonstrate PBI at sprint review
- Flow Management
	- Release flow
		- Must have
		- Nice to have
		- Won't have
