## What are Estimation and Velocity?

- Estimation: guessing how much work there is left to do
- Velocity: how fasts the team is doing work
- By dividing the work left by how fast the work is done allows for a calculation of how long it is going to take

## Three types of Estimation

1. Portfolio backlog
2. Product backlog
3. Sprint backlog

## Estimation Concepts

- Estimate as a team
- Value accuracy over precision
- Estimates are not commitments
- Use relative size estimates

## Estimation Units

- Story Points vs. Ideal Days
- Basically the same
	- Exact value for each is flexible
	- Different terms for a unit of measure
- Ideal days can be confusing
	- If it is, then story points are probably the better unit for you

## Planning Poker

- Estimation Scale
- How to play
	- Usually uses Fibonacci numbers
		- Prevents fine divisions ("...is this a 9 or a 10 or a 9.5...?" is harder than "is this a 9 or a 13?")
- Benefits
	- Get size estimates
	- More importantly, get a better understanding of the product

## Velocity

- Calculating velocity
- Affecting velocity
	- New tools
	- Training
	- Change of personnel
	- Overtime
- Misusing velocity
	- Point inflation
	- Cutting corners
