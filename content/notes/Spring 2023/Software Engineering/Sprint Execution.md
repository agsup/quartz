## Overview

- Sprint execution is like a "mini-project"
- Takes up most of a sprint (up to around 75% of it)
- Participants
	- Team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner answer clarifying questions

## Process

- Execution starts with the goal and the backlog, and ends with a potentially shippable product
	- Remember that the goal of Scrum is to have a potentially shippable product at the end of every sprint

## Flow Management

- Dev team must manage the flow of work during execution to meet the goal, includes
	- Parallel work

## Task Performance

- Dev team members need to be skilled in good technical practices for Scrum to work
- Many good practices come from Agile/Extreme
	- Test-driven
	- Refactoring
	- Pair-programming
	- Continuous Integration
	- Collective code ownership
	- Automated testing

## Communication

- Easier in a short timebox with a small team (like in a sprint)
