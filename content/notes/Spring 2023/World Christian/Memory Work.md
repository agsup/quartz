- [First Verse Memorization](notes/Spring%202023/World%20Christian/Memory%20Work/First%20Verse%20Memorization.md)

##### *Note: most of my memorization has been done orally, rather than on paper/type. The way in which memorization works best for me is by recalling chunks of the verse, then slowly beginning to string those chunks together into a full verse/set of verses. That being said, I didn't think it would be worth submitting several typed sets of verses, but I could do that on the next notes submission if you would prefer me to, or in the future I could attach pictures of handwritten memory verses to these pages if that would be best. Sorry I didn't ask you earlier, I only just now noticed it when rerunning over the requirements for this submission.*
