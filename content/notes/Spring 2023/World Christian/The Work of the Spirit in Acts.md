## Acts 2

- Speaking in many tongues
- Mighty rushing wind
- Tongues of fire

 Reference to Joel:

> "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

- Apostles tell the people what they have done, and they are pricked at the heart

## Acts 4

- People noticed that the apostles were uneducated and common, but bold and courageous, and noticed that they had been with Jesus

## Acts 5

- The apostles obey God, not men
- They are very confident and bold
- They are flogged and warned, but they still speak of Jesus
- They rejoice that they suffered for Jesus, which is truly indicative of the presence of the Holy Spirit
- They are becoming less like normal humans

## Acts 6

- Problems in the church
  - Leaders?
  - Greek/Hebrew widows (disparity)
- How does a Spirit-led church solve a problem?
- Seven Leaders are appointed by the Apostles who are of good reputation and full of the Spirit and Wisdom
  - The requirements are so high because pride/ego is to be avoided
  - These Leaders are chosen to serve, so humility is a requirement
  - They are also chosen to be fair Leaders who can help solve problems

## Acts 7

- Powerful Spirit-driven speaker
- Stephen rails against those who don't listen to the Spirit
- He is stoned for his speech by the Sanhedrin
- Behaves in a very Christ-like manner while being executed because of how much of the Spirit was in him

## Acts 8

- Saul is destroying the church
- Saul behaves in a fleshly way, despite being very religious
- Philip goes to Samaria to preach the Gospel
  - This shows that things are changing in the world
- Ethiopians are also included

## Acts 9

- Saul is converted and transformed into a follower of Christ
- Is filled with the Spirit
- This brought a time of peace for the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria

## Acts 10

- Cornelius
  - Centurion in the Italian Regiment
  - God-Fearing
  - Gives to God monetarily
  - Good man
  - This alone is not enough to be saved
- Peter's Vision
  - Told to "kill and eat" (traditionally) unclean animals
  - God rebukes Peter for calling the food unclean because God has made the food clean
  - The same applies to nations (no nation, even Gentile, is "unclean")
  - The Gift of the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles shocked the circumcised believers
  - Cornelius is saved that day

## Acts 11

- The Spirit pushes people way out of their comfort zone
- To not embrace the Gentiles is to <u>oppose God.</u>
- Church in Antioch
  - Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to Antioch
    - Specializes in encouragement
    - Full of the Spirit
  - Note: There are people in the church that lack the Spirit (Barnabas is not one of them)
- Barnabas is sent to Tarsus to look for Saul to send him to Antioch
- Barnabas didn't define Saul by his past or his mistakes, but by his potential

## Acts 13

- Barnabas and Saul are set apart by the Spirit and sent off into the world
- Moral: Don't stop the Spirit. Keep an ear open for it

## Acts 15

- Some taught that circumcision was required for salvation
- Paul and Barnabas sharply argued against this
- Spirit-filled people can have disagreements
  - Ex. Paul and Barnabas over John Mark
    - Paul thinks John Mark is a quitter
    - Barnabas sees in John what he saw in Saul
    - Paul and Barnabas split over this disagreement
    - Opinion: Paul is in the wrong

## Acts 16

- HS kept the Spirit from entering Asia and Bithynia, Spirit wanted them in Macedonia instead (Paul has a vision in the night of a Macedonian man)
- Sometimes doors close with the Spirit, especially when it's trying to guide you somewhere specific
- One of the "we" passages
- Paul's dream required interpretation given to them by the Spirit
- First baptized in Macedonia is the non-Macedonian woman Lydia
- Paul and Silas praise at midnight in prison despite being jailed unfairly

## Acts 19

- One of the "special cases" of the coming of the Spirit
  
> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.

- This is after they are baptized in the name of Jesus
- Reiterates that the Spirit and baptism are supposed to be intertwined

## Acts 26

- Paul is defending himself before King Agrippa
- Paul is not afraid to say some uncomfortable truths to the King
