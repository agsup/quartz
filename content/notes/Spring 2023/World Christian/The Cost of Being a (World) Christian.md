- Main point: self-awareness/sacrifice is essential to the faith

## Why is this Hard?

- The "cost" is not stressed in our preaching and teaching
- It does not sit well with our worldly values of freedom and independence
- The idea of "cost" has been misused
- No one likes to be made to feel like they are not doing enough, or stated positively, we all liked to be praised
- After having the discussion, it's very easy to fall into "judging mode"

## What this lesson is Not

- A discussion of the way of salvation 
	- We are saved by grace through faith. washed by the blood of Jesus, **not** by our self-denial
- Some kind of spiritual elitism
	- Those who are taking up their crosses daily are not interested in what everyone else is doing and making comparisons
- An attempt to "water down" or soften the call to total self-denial
- A lesson to give us all a "guilt trip"

## The Cost of Discipleship

- Luke 14:25-35
	- Jesus' response to many following
	- It involves denying self and putting Christ before *all* relationships, "hating" other relationships in comparison
	- The "price" is not negotiable
		- "You **cannot** be my disciple"
	- Those who refuse to accept the "price" are considered *useless* (see 14:34-35)

## The Crux

- The call to follow Christ must involve the follower taking on an **"enlisted"** frame of mind
	- *Enlisted*, like *military*
- To be ready to do whatever, whenever, wherever for the sake of Christ
	- Important to note that there is *nothing to negotiate*
