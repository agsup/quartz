- Main point: self-awareness/sacrifice is essential to the faith

## Why is this Hard?

- The "cost" is not stressed in our preaching and teaching
- It does not sit well with our worldly values of freedom and independence
- The idea of "cost" has been misused
- No one likes to be made to feel like they are not doing enough, or stated positively, we all liked to be praised
- After having the discussion, it's very easy to fall into "judging mode"

## What this lesson is Not

- A discussion of the way of salvation 
	- We are saved by grace through faith. washed by the blood of Jesus, **not** by our self-denial
- Some kind of spiritual elitism
	- Those who are taking up their crosses daily are not interested in what everyone else is doing and making comparisons
- An attempt to "water down" or soften the call to total self-denial
- A lesson to give us all a "guilt trip"

## The Cost of Discipleship

- Luke 14:25-35
	- Jesus' response to many following
	- It involves denying self and putting Christ before *all* relationships, "hating" other relationships in comparison
	- The "price" is not negotiable
		- "You **cannot** be my disciple"
	- Those who refuse to accept the "price" are considered *useless* (see 14:34-35)

## The Crux

- The call to follow Christ must involve the follower taking on an **"enlisted"** frame of mind
	- *Enlisted*, like *military*
- To be ready to do whatever, whenever, wherever for the sake of Christ
	- Important to note that there is *nothing to negotiate*

## The Paradox of the Cost

- Matthew 16:21-28
	- The meaning of *psyche*, contrasted with *zoe* and *bios*
		- *bios, biotikos*: lowest level of life, very closely associated with the idea of "flesh", can also mean "possessions"
		- *psyche*: animal-like life, breathing, eating, that which constitutes being "alive" in the fleshly sense, opposite of "spiritual"
- Those who preserve their life will lose it, those who lose it for Jesus will gain it.
	- *This is the paradox*
- The *psyche* is what *we want to be*, but to follow Jesus is to be what *He wants us to be*.

## Lessons from the Seed

- John 12:20-26
- The seed must die for it to produce fruit
- Romans 12:1-2

## The Meaning of Baptism

- Romans 6:1-18
	- If indeed we understand what happened when we were immersed, there is no longer an "I" or a "we"
- Galatians 2:20
	- It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me
- *You* can no longer do what *you* want to do because *you* ***died*** during baptism, leaving only Christ

## Reflected in our Attitude Toward Sin (and what makes us Stumble)

- Matthew 5:29-30
- How dear to you is your secret sin?
- What relationships are you in which cause you to stumble?
- What are you willing to give in exchange for your soul?

## The Test Case

- Matthew 19:16-30; Mark 10:17-30; Luke 18:18-30
- Why was Jesus so hard on the rich young ruler?
	- He wants the "easy way to heaven"
	- The young man thinks he is "good"
		- We have the same problem in modern Christianity

## Why Give Our Life?

- It was from God to begin with, we are only giving Him what's His
- We have been purchased by the blood of Christ, our life isn't ours anyway
- Christ gave his life for us, we should lay our lives down for others
- We don't know the best way to live our lives anyway!

## The Call to Be a World Christian

- ***Are you willing to pay the price?***
