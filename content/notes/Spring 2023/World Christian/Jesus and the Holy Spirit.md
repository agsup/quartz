# Jesus and the Holy Spirit

## Luke 4

- Led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted (1-2)
- Returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee (14-15)
- Regarded as nothing more than "Joseph's son"
	- Generally well liked, but not regarded as the Son of God

## John 3

- How Jesus speaks to others about the Spirit
- Note: Pharisees were persecuted by the Romans for being too radical
- Nicodemus respected and learned from Jesus
- Decided to give Jesus a proper burial despite the view of his peers
- Calls out his peers as they give Jesus an unfair trial to save their skin
- Discussion with Jesus about being born again
	- Water vs Spirit
	- <table><tr><td>Spirit/Water</td><td>Flesh</td></tr><tr><td>Spirit->Spirit</td><td>Flesh->Flesh</td></tr></table>
	- Note: Sometimes it is impossible to baptize someone before death, but sometimes it is difficult but possible, in which case an attempt might be made

## John 10

- *Zoe*: <u>Real</u> (eternal, genuine) life
- *Bios*: Biological/Physical life
- Bios mirrors Zoe, but in the same way that a picture or statue mirrors a person
- A man is naturally a creation, not a descendant, of God
- A man can have his Bios end, but continue through Zoe, which is obtained through the rebirth of baptism according to the Christian Faith
- Essentially, living only in bios is being a <u>dead man walking</u>

## Our Responsibility

- Are we and Undertaker or a Mid-wife?
	- Do we make the dead look alive or do we actually help them through obtaining *Zoe*?
