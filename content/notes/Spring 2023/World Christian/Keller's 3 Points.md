## The Reference Point for Evaluating Culture

- Evaluate based on God's Holiness (not based on *your* culture)
- Note the response of those who catch a glimpse of God's glory (Isaiah 6:5; Luke 5:8; Rev 4:8)
- The challenge of being "in the world" and not "of the world"

## Jesus is the Perfect Model

- The Word (Logos) ***became*** Flesh (sarx)
- He became like us in every way, but without sin
- He was in the world, but not of the world
- He warned us, do not be surprised of the world hates you

## The Mantra of the World Christian

- 1 Corinthians 9:19-23
- Be like them so as to see from their perspective and win them over through interpersonal Christlike love
- Extremely important for outreach

## NT Case Studies in Culture

- John 4: Jesus and the Samaritan Woman
	- Unusual because Jesus is talking intellectually not only to a *Samaritan*, but to a *Samaritan* *woman*
- Acts 10: Peter and Cornelius
	- Unusual because Peter is in the house of a Roman
- Acts 15: The Jerusalem Conference
- The contextualization of the gospel message *throughout* Acts (13, 14, 17)

## The World Christian and Culture

- God is supra-cultural by nature
	- I would say *exo*-cultural, meaning outside of it. Slide uses supra-
- The Eternal World became incarnate as our model
- We live within a certain culture, not as passive participants but rather as change agents, by the means of a life and testimony of love and service, bringing to light the truth of God
- Tough we live in a world, may we never forget, that we represent a "kingdom not of this world"
