- ## Goal:
	- To emphasize the Holy Spirit and his work<br>as the driving force in both transforming<br>and bringing good news to the world
- ## Holy Spirit and Kingdom
	- Empowerment through the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:32)
	- Condition for being an apostle was to have been with Jesus (Acts 4:13)
		- Important because the apostles were otherwise unremarkable
	- The Holy Spirit will come to the disciples and <u>transform</u> them (Acts 2)
		- It would be dangerous for them to go out before the Spirit is upon them because it would be their words, not God's
		- They are even told to go into <u>Samaria</u> to deliver the Gospel
