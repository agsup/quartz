- ## Analogies

  - Verse 11
    - >I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 12Â His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
  - John the Baptist is talking about who will go to Heaven and who will go to Hell
  - Wheat is the faithful, chaff is the unfaithful/unfruitful

- ## Jesus' Baptism

  - John wanted to be baptized by Jesus, Jesus is instead baptized by John
- Important question: "do I have to do \[insert Christian thing here]?"
  - Technically no, but that's the wrong question
  - If your mind is in the right place it will come naturally to *want* to do it
