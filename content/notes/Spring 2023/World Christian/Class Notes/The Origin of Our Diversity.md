## The Natural Way of Things

- Creation is "good"
- Unity = "good"
- Sin/Rebellion = shame as a natural response
	- This shame/sin/rebellion results in *violence*

## Languages

- There is no documented "mother language"
	- This is because of the abrupt death of that language during the Tower of Babel incident
- Tower of Babel story suggests that diversity's origin was from rebellion and sinful pride resulting from human unity(?)

## God's Plan for Israel

- Gen 12:1-3 w/ Gen 14:18-20
	- God through Abraham will bless *all* ***nations*** (important)
- Gen 49 - Judah chosen
	- Scepter will be passed along through Judah until it returns to its original owner (God/Jesus)
	- The original owner of the Scepter commands obedience of ***all nations***
- 2 Sam 7:12-14 - David chosen
	- Too much blood on his hands, doesn't get to build the temple
- Psalm 67
	- Before reading this, message seems ethnocentric (only about Israel)
	- This Psalm shows that God's blessing is for all nations
- Isaiah 2:1-5
	- Israel will the the "base of operations" for God's plans
	- We (Gentiles) are still a part of the plans
- Isaiah 42:1-7
	- 
- Isaiah 49:6 (Acts 13:47)

## Jesus and the Nations

- Matthew 2 - The visit of the Magi
	- The Magi are *astrologers*
	- Reading between the lines of Matthew, the Magi represent the (Gentile) nations coming to worship Christ, bringing gifts/tribute
- Luke 2: 29-32 - Simeon's announcement
	- It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lordâ€™s Messiah. (26)
	- He immediately knows that Jesus is the Messiah, and can die in peace after having seen Him
- Luke 4 - Jesus' Sermon in Nazareth
	- He emphasizes that He is here to save *everyone*
	- It is too much for the Jews to handle
- Jesus' contact with the Roman Centurion, Syro-Phoenician, Samaritans, etc.
	- The Centurion was *more faithful* than any of the Jews
	- These Gentiles are much more responsive to Jesus than any of the Jews
- Matt 24:14 = "The Gospel will be preached in the whole world..."

## The Great Commission

- Matthew 28:18-20 & Mark 16:15-16
- Think about whether or not you're actually doing it...

## The Preparation

- Acts 1
	- Jesus' Resurrection
	- Jesus' Teaching about the Kingdom
	- Jesus' Promise
	- The Disciples' Question
	- Jesus' Plan
- The Apostles struggle understanding the scope of this
- They discuss it anyway because of their instruction

## The First Kingdom Sermon

- This is what was spoken by the prophet
- Jesus is the One! He arose from the dead, according to the prophecies!
- He is exalted to the right of the Father
- All of his enemies will be made footstools
- He is Lord (Adonai) and Christ
- It is his Name!

## The Spreading Flame

- Acts is a recording of how God through the HS begins to bring in all the nations. It wasn't always easy going.
- Acts 8 - The Samaritans and an Ethiopian
	- Seen as an outlier
- Acts 10 - Cornelius and the Gentiles
	- This set people over the edge
- Acts 15 - The Jerusalem Council
	- About whether Gentiles can be accepted as Gentiles (the answer is yes)

## The Basis of Unity

- Ephesians 2:11-22 
	- Christ's Church was founded as his one body, in which all walls or barriers of separation have been destroyed.
- The Price: the Death of Christ
	- Christ's death is the response to the Tower of Babel
- Galatians 3:26-28
	- We are all one *through Christ*
	- Equality is difficult (almost impossible) for humans to come up with on their own
- Hebrews 12:22-24

## God's Ultimate Purpose

- Revelation 5:9-10
	- The Scroll could not be open by anyone because there were none worthy
	- The Lamb is worthy to open the Scroll
- Revelation 7:9-10
	- Large sections of the world still untouched by Christianity
	- God wants *all nations* before the throne

## What Can I do?

- Pray to the Lord of Harvest to send forth more workers into the fields (Matt. 9:37-38)
	- Pray in faith, being ready no only to partner with those going, but also ***be ready to go yourself*** if God calls you
- Be a faithful fellow-laborer with God (1 Cor. 3:9) in discipling the nations NOW!

## India

- Important Statistics
	- 5.84% Christian (at the highest)
	- 88% unreached by missionaries
	- Mostly Hindu
		- Hinduism as a polytheistic belief is very syncretistic (many Christians are getting lumped in statistically with Hindus because YHWH gets included in the pantheon)
	- 30.1% urban

## Human Value/Worth

- A Christian concept, not universally recognized by all countries
- China: "We don't want to see people with defects"
- India: "We can get rid of them, they cause only harm and give no benefit"

## William Carey (1761-1834)

- "Father of Modern Missions"
- *Deathless Sermon* from Isaiah 54:2-3
- *"**Expect** great things from God, **attempt** great things for God"*
- Serampore Trio

## Europeans in India (1501-1739)

- Colonialism was rampant
- Missionary work to India was frowned upon because if they were Christian, the Europeans would have to admit the humanity of the Indians

## 11 Commandments of Missions

1. Immortal souls have infinite value
2. Be informed about the "snares and delusions of the heathens"
3. Don't be Eurocentric, it hurts the mission
4. Watch for all opportunity for good, even when it's hot and you're tired
5. Christ crucified is the main subject of the preaching
6. Earn the friendship of the people, it builds confidence (goes both ways)
7. Build up the souls that are gathered
8. Turn the work over to the natives as soon as possible. This helps the faith be self-sustaining, giving them power
9. Try your hardest to get a translation in their native tongue. Build schools to help
10. Stay alert in prayer, ask God to quench idols
11. *missing one: find it.*
