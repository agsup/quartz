## The Natural Way of Things

- Creation is "good"
- Unity = "good"
- Sin/Rebellion = shame as a natural response
	- This shame/sin/rebellion results in *violence*

## Languages

- There is no documented "mother language"
	- This is because of the abrupt death of that language during the Tower of Babel incident
- Tower of Babel story suggests that diversity's origin was from rebellion and sinful pride resulting from human unity(?)

## God's Plan for Israel

- Gen 12:1-3 w/ Gen 14:18-20
	- God through Abraham will bless *all* ***nations*** (important)
- Gen 49 - Judah chosen
	- Scepter will be passed along through Judah until it returns to its original owner (God/Jesus)
	- The original owner of the Scepter commands obedience of ***all nations***
- 2 Sam 7:12-14 - David chosen
	- Too much blood on his hands, doesn't get to build the temple
- Psalm 67
	- Before reading this, message seems ethnocentric (only about Israel)
	- This Psalm shows that God's blessing is for all nations
- Isaiah 2:1-5
	- Israel will the the "base of operations" for God's plans
	- We (Gentiles) are still a part of the plans
- Isaiah 42:1-7
	- 
- Isaiah 49:6 (Acts 13:47)

## Jesus and the Nations

- Matthew 2 - The visit of the Magi
	- The Magi are *astrologers*
	- Reading between the lines of Matthew, the Magi represent the (Gentile) nations coming to worship Christ, bringing gifts/tribute
- Luke 2: 29-32 - Simeon's announcement
	- It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lordâ€™s Messiah. (26)
	- He immediately knows that Jesus is the Messiah, and can die in peace after having seen Him
- Luke 4 - Jesus' Sermon in Nazareth
	- He emphasizes that He is here to save *everyone*
	- It is too much for the Jews to handle
- Jesus' contact with the Roman Centurion, Syro-Phoenician, Samaritans, etc.
	- The Centurion was *more faithful* than any of the Jews
	- These Gentiles are much more responsive to Jesus than any of the Jews
- Matt 24:14 = "The Gospel will be preached in the whole world..."

## The Great Commission

- Matthew 28:18-20 & Mark 16:15-16
- Think about whether or not you're actually doing it...


## The Preparation

- Acts 1
	- Jesus' Resurrection
	- Jesus' Teaching about the Kingdom
	- Jesus' Promise
	- The Disciples' Question
	- Jesus' Plan
- The Apostles struggle understanding the scope of this
- They discuss it anyway because of their instruction

## The First Kingdom Sermon

- This is what was spoken by the prophet
- Jesus is the One! He arose from the dead, according to the prophecies!
- He is exalted to the right of the Father
- All of his enemies will be made footstools
- He is Lord (Adonai) and Christ
- It is his Name!

## The Spreading Flame

- Acts is a recording of how God through the HS begins to bring in all the nations. It wasn't always easy going.
- Acts 8 - The Samaritans and an Ethiopian
	- Seen as an outlier
- Acts 10 - Cornelius and the Gentiles
	- This set people over the edge
- Acts 15 - The Jerusalem Council
	- About whether Gentiles can be accepted as Gentiles (the answer is yes)

## The Basis of Unity

- Ephesians 2:11-22 
	- Christ's Church was founded as his one body, in which all walls or barriers of separation have been destroyed.
- The Price: the Death of Christ
	- Christ's death is the response to the Tower of Babel
- Galatians 3:26-28
- Hebrews 12:22-24
