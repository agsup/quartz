## Goal

- To emphasize the Holy Spirit and his work as the driving force in both transforming and bringing good news to the world

## Holy Spirit and Kingdom

- Empowerment through the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:32)
  - Condition for being an apostle was to have been with Jesus (Acts 4:13)
    - Important because the apostles were otherwise unremarkable
  - The Holy Spirit will come to the disciples and <u>transform</u> them (Acts 2)
    - It would be dangerous for them to go out before the Spirit is upon them because it would be their words, not God's
    - They are even told to go into <u>Samaria</u> to deliver the Gospel
