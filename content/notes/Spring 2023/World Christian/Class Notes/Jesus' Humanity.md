## John 1

- "Word": *logos*/*dao*
  - *logos* is a word with undefined meaning, John "baptizes" the word (gives it a holy meaning)
  - John 1:1 outlines the Trinity

> In the beginning was the Word...
> 
> The Word was with God...
> 
> ...and The Word was God

  - The Word just was, which is where God's name "I AM"/YHWH means
- The Word became flesh
  - Becoming indicates a creation taking place
  - The Word becoming flesh is a profound moment of the Creator becoming something Created

## Philippians 2:5-11

> In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
> 
> Who, being in very nature God,
> 
> did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
> 
> rather, he made himself nothing  
> 
> by taking the very nature of a servant, 
> 
> being made in human likeness.  
> 
> And being found in appearance as a man,
> 
> he humbled himself  
> 
> by becoming obedient to death— 
> 
> even death on a cross!
> 
> Therefore God exalted him to the highest place  
> 
> and gave him the name that is above every name,  
> 
> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,  
> 
> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,  
> 
> and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,  
    to the glory of God the Father.

- Here's the kicker:
  - Hebrews 2:17: For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way...
- This transition from Creator to Flesh is symbolic of becoming <i><u>nothing</u></i>
- As a result, Jesus sympathizes with our <u>weaknesses</u>
- Christ became obedient even to death, which is important as God is beholden to no one
- Also of note: Jesus is higher than the angels, but by becoming man became less than the angels for a time
- Christ also dies, which is an indicator of his complete transition
- In the end times, all enemies will be subdued to Jesus, including death
  - Then Jesus will be subject to God, making all things under God through Jesus
  - Important because Jesus is not equal in hierarchy to God, though they are both very high

*However,* Jesus is still completely God. How is this? [next](notes/Spring%202023/World%20Christian/Class%20Notes/Jesus%20and%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.md)
