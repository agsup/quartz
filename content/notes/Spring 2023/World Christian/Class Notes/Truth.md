## What is Truth?

- $\alpha \lambda \epsilon \theta \epsilon \iota \alpha$ (*Aletheia*) in Greek
	- Aristotle: *Metaphysics* 1011b
		- > “to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true.”
	- Plato: "Cave of Idealism"
		- Shadows on the wall illustrating reality
	- $\alpha \lambda \epsilon \theta \epsilon \iota \alpha$ is used 98 times in Bible, 20 times in John
- Dallas Willard
	- Truth vs. Knowledge
		- Can something be known if it is untrue?
	- "Truth does not accommodate belief"
	- "Truth is indifferent"
	- "Humans are ***set on*** reshaping truth"

## Why is Truth Evasive?

- Limitations of man
	- We cannot know for sure whether anything is true
- Theory of relativity and its impact on truth
	- Nothing is absolute anymore!
- Imperfections of those who promote truth
- The lack of unity among those who make claims of truth
	- Church denominations...
- The problem of truth in the physical, sensory world
	- > "Where did I put my keys?" - Dr. Jackson

## Truth Is What "Is"

- Truth cannot come from a created being because it is too fluid
- God "is" as he revealed in the Tetragrammation
	- YHWH: "I Am"
	- Exodus 3:14
- Without an "I Am", there is no absolute truth

## What Truth is Not

- Not necessarily the specific teachings of any church or individual
- Not what either political party promotes
- Not what "feels right"
- Not relative

## "What is Truth?" - Pilate

- Jesus was born to speak truth
- Jesus is truth incarnate

## How Truth Comes to Us

- Embodied in God who is outside the limits of creation
- Eternal Logos takes on flesh and demonstrates truth in a fallen world
- Truth is alive through Jesus, who is full of the Spirit by which he speaks.
- His truth is dynamic, not static.

## How Does Truth Act?

- Jesus and the adulteress
	- Might not have even been an adulteress, the man isn't mentioned, though he's not important in the story
- John 8:7
	- When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”
- By throwing a stone, one would have to lie

## The Big Difference

| Legal View of Truth         | View of Truth as a Person                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Bible is a Legal Document   | Bible is a Revelation of God's nature      |
| Seeks to conform to the law | Seeks to conform to God's will             |
| Give 10%                    | Give with justice, mercy, and faithfulness |

## What Truth Is

> "I'm not just getting senile, I know I'm repeating myself." - Dr. Jackson

- Truth is God, embodied in the person of Jesus Christ, reflected in his actions and teachings
- It takes form in our minds differently, making it seem relative
	- Examples include circumcision, Sabbath, etc.
- Truth is the way we respond to God in worship
- How do we determine truth?
	1. We must have the Spirit of God (1 John 2:20-21)
	2. Believe in the Truth (John 14:6)
	3. Listen to the Spirit (John 16:13)
	4. Listen to the voice of truth (John 18:37)
	5. Abide in (Jesus') teachings (John 8:31-32)
	6. Come into the light (John 3:21)

## Three Models of Truth

| Legalist                                         | Relativist                                                                                              | Spiritual                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Rule of law, truth is static (and has loopholes) | Rules are suggestions, truth is relative to me                                                              | Not under law but grace, truth is relative to God     |
| Lawbreakers should be punished                   | Lawbreakers should be reformed                                                                          | Lawbreaker should be transformed                      | 
| Outward conformity is enough                     | Wants everyone to "be nice", which actually means everyone compromises, not necessarily actual kindness | Only full rebirth can allow one to conform with truth |

## One way of Looking

![](notes/Spring%202023/World%20Christian/Pasted%20image%2020230224142830.png)

- At the center of this is God and his absolute truth
- Outer circles are rules/societal truths derived from it
- Farthest out are too far removed, further in are perfectly fine
	- Ex. Too far is requiring circumcision, further in is "do not steal"
	- One of the furthest in is "love the Lord your God"
