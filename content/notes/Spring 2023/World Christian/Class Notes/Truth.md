## What is Truth?

- $\alpha \lambda \epsilon \theta \epsilon \iota \alpha$ (*Aletheia*) in Greek
	- Aristotle: *Metaphysics* 1011b
		- > “to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true.”
	- Plato: "Cave of Idealism"
		- Shadows on the wall illustrating reality
	- $\alpha \lambda \epsilon \theta \epsilon \iota \alpha$ is used 98 times in Bible, 20 times in John
- Dallas Willard
	- Truth vs. Knowledge
		- Can something be known if it is untrue?
	- "Truth does not accommodate belief"
	- "Truth is indifferent"
	- "Humans are ***set on*** reshaping truth"

## Why is Truth Evasive?

- Limitations of man
	- We cannot know for sure whether anything is true
- Theory of relativity and its impact on truth
	- Nothing is absolute anymore!
- Imperfections of those who promote truth
- The lack of unity among those who make claims of truth
	- Church denominations...
- The problem of truth in the physical, sensory world
	- > "Where did I put my keys?" - Dr. Jackson

## Truth Is What "Is"

- Truth cannot come from a created being because it is too fluid
- God "is" as he revealed in the Tetragrammation
	- YHWH: "I Am"
	- Exodus 3:14
- Without an "I Am", there is no absolute truth

## What Truth is Not

- Not necessarily the specific teachings of any church or individual
- Not what either political party promotes
- Not what "feels right"
- Not relative

## "What is Truth?" - Pilate

- Jesus was born to speak truth
- Jesus is truth incarnate

## How Truth Comes to Us

- Embodied in God who is outside the limits of creation
- Eternal Logos takes on flesh and demonstrates truth in a fallen world
- Truth is alive through Jesus, who is full of the Spirit by which he speaks.
- His truth is dynamic, not static.

## How Does Truth Act?

- Jesus and the adulteress
	- Might not have even been an adulteress, the man isn't mentioned, though he's not important in the story
- John 8:7
- By throwing a stone, one would have to lie
