## Romans 5

- Not just forgiven by God, but also loved by God
  - Therefore, we can rejoice in suffering for Him
- First Adam doomed us all, Second Adam (Jesus) saved us all
  - Choose a lineage

## Romans 7

- Faith is like marriage
    - One husband
    - Bound by law
    - Cheating is bad
- Man's nature is to break laws and go against God
- Paul says, "For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do."

## Romans 8

- If you are not *led* by the Spirit, you are not *of* the Spirit

## 1 Corinthians

- Wisdom of the World vs. the Wisdom of God
- Worldly King vs. crucified (sacrificed)
- No one truly knows the thoughts of God
- Spiritual realities are explained through Spiritual words, and are only understood through the Spirit
- Note: Worldly Christians (not to be confused with World Christians) are not *fake Christians*, just not developed yet

| Wisdom of the World               | Wisdom of God                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Worldly King                      | Crucified Sacrifice                               |
| Can be known                      | Unknown except to God himself                     |
| Can be explained with human words | can only be explained/interpreted with the Spirit |
| Human                             | Godly                                             |

- *Psychikos*                                                     
    - The natural person (in other words, the *psyche* or ***soul***) 
    - This person is being led by their own human desires             
    - *Psychikos* cannot inherently understand the Spirit             

- Flesh        
    -  Jealous      
    -  Quarrelling  
    -  Angry        
    -  Judgemental  
    -  Arrogant     
    -  Gossips      
    -  Make excuses 
- Spirit-Filled
    - Servant
    - Becomes nothing (makes way for God)
        - Worth is in God, not in anything worldly
    - God's Co-Workers

- Better to "take the hit" than to bicker with another Christian in front of unbelievers
