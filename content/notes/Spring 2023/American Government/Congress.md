- OUR legislative branch
	- They work for us!
- How a Bill becomes a Law
	- Same bill has to pass the house and the senate, then it is approved by the President
	- Bill must be introduced by a member of Congress
	- Bill Drafting makes sure the language is perfectly detailed
	- Committee reports bill out to another committee or to one of the two Houses
	- Bill is then placed on a calendar (list of bills to be read and voted on)
	- House Rules Committee sets the rules for consideration
		- 1 hour is indicative of a big decision, and is the maximum allocated time
		- Filibustering is a thing that exists, and it's stupid
	- Conference committee works out the differences between the bills passed by HOR and Senate
	- President then can sign it or veto it
	- If it is vetoed, the it returns to the house of origin and the process restarts
		- Or there can be a veto override, but with a partisan government, no way. Too stubborn.
	- A pocket veto occurs in the past 10 days of session, and this kills a bill nearly completely
		- States don't usually do this, it's mostly a federal thing
	- 
- Most bills die because they never make it to the agenda of the committee
- Speaking of committees...
    - Committees are where lots of the work gets done
    - Committees have subcommittees
        - Ex. Education committee has a K12 committee, a college committee, etc.
    - Types:
        - Joint committee
        - Special/Select Committee
        - Budget committee (3 types)
            - Taxing
            - Spending
            - Balance (between taxing and spending)
        - Standing
            - Workhorses of Congress
            - They do all of the research/sentiment analysis
        - Conference (not the same as party conferences)
        - Ways and Means Committee
            - Revenue committee for the House
            - Raises revenue for the Government
            - First stop for ALL revenue bills
            - "Cadillac" of Committees
            - Creates exemptions, credits, and <u>loopholes</u> 
            - Chair: Charlie Rangel (D-NY)
                - He got caught <u>3 times</u> not paying his taxes
                - Kept his position because he helped New York! (cringe!)
                - New chairman time
            - Now we have Jason Smith
            - Now the Committee is <u>super frikkin Republican</u> (gross, too partisan!!! yuck!)
                - Their press releases look like articles from <u>Fox News!</u>
        - House Appropriations
            - Spends money to fund government
            - Appropriation: the legal authorization to expend governmental funds
            - 12 subcommittees
            - Pork: Wasteful spending
            - Always behind...
        - House Rules
            - The most powerful committee
            - Bills must go through this committee to go to the House
            - Sets a rule for each bill about how debate will occur
            - MUCH more powerful than even the Senate
            - New chair is Tom Cole and he's a very, <u>very</u> old looking man
# Extra Credit
- State of the Union
- ASI Speaker

# The Twins
- Specialization
    - Members specialize based on prior education/occupation
- Reciprocity
    - Members of different specialties agree on a thing
## Seniority

- Unwritten, still powerful
- Length of time in office = level of seniority
- Senate Pro Tempore: Longest serving member of majority (traditionally)

## Caucus

- Gathering for a political purpose
- Gathering of all members of the same party serving in the House/Senate
- Republican majority in the house calls its caucus the Republican Conference

### Congressional Caucuses

- see textbook

## Leadership Organization

- Institutional Leadership vs. Political Leadership
    - see textbook

## Majority and Minority Leadership

- Steve Scalise is the Majority House Leader
- Hakeem Jeffries (young boi) is the Minority House Leader
- Chuck Schumer is the Majority Senate Leader
- Mitch McConnell is the Minority Senate Leader
- Whips
    - Whips coordinate the party positions (keeps the dogs from running away)
    - Counts votes
    - Keeps votes in line
- Twists arms

## Party Loyalty

- Mavericks: members who show less loyalty to their party and do not abide by informal rules

    - Actually care about stuff, and talk with other parties to try to get stuff done
- Floor Lingo
    - Calendar: list of bill scheduled for hearing/vote (same as committee agendas)
    - Majority vs. Super-majority
        - textbook
- The Well

## Filibusters

- Only in the Senate
- Unlimited debate
- Holds progress captive (is cringe)
- Rule 22 can break a filibuster, requires 60% vote to use
- Cloture is a vote to end the debate
- Can be used for good (occasionally)

## Congressional Staff

- Constituency Service is a major task of members' staff
- Legislative functions include devising proposals, negotiating agreements, organizing hearings, and meeting with lobbyists/admins
- Members' staff consider themselves advocates of their employers
- New trend: staffers succeeding their bosses
- 35,000 employees
- Committee staff has declined in recent years
- Minimum personal staff: 18 full time, 4 part time, no limit but budget in the Senate
- Elected Staff:
    - Clerk/Secretary
    - Sergeants at Arms
    - Chaplains

## Executive/Legislative Tension

- Even if they're from the same party, they don't always get along
- Even if the President was previously in the legislature  they don't trust each other

## Advise and Consent: Confirming and Ratifying

- Senate confirms President's appointments
- Senate ratifies all treaties

## Oversight

- Government Accountability Office (GAO)

## Investigation

- Unlimited power (uh oh)
    - See McCarthyism
- Congress can investigate whatever they want
- Viewed super negatively
- Sometimes turned towards the Executive, making tensions worse

## Impeachment

- House impeaches, Senate holds the trial
- Johnson, Clinton and Trump were all impeached, but not convicted
- Nixon saw that he would have been convicted, so resigned

## War Powers Act

- Congress has not used power to declare war since WWII
- Criticism of the President's role in Vietnam led to the War Powers Act of 1973
- President may only commit troops abroad for a period of 60 days (90 if including withdrawal)
- Congress must approve a longer period
- Nixon vetoed it, veto overruled
- No matter what, Congress holds the purse.

## Incumbency

- But public disapproval!
- There are still advantages because:
    - Staff
    - Franking (mail)
    - Publicity/Media Coverage
    - "All publicity is good publicity"
    - Travel funds
    - TL;DR, it's much, much cheaper running as an incumbent
    - Voter apathy pays off for the incumbents
    - Reapportionment is friendly to incumbents
- Disadvantages:
    - Publicly hated (but the hate isn't acted upon)
    - Like, really, really hated (less than 1/10 of the population <u>doesn't hate Congress!</u>)
- Term Limits?
    - They're not going to do it federally because it's too profitable!
    - Some states were able to get it done

## Reapportionment and Redistricting

-  Decennial Census
    - Every 10 years
    - Only (intended) purpose of this census is purely population (everything else is bonus because `data data data...`)
- Apportionment
    - Distribution of voters into districts, dividing of representation by population
    - Is judiciable (**this is crucial**)
        - There have been court cases over these (very good!)
        - Cannot gerrymander based on race (unfortunately party is still on the table)
- Mal-apportionment is a bad split
- Reapportionment
    - The process of redistributing the populations among districts
- Redistricting
    - The process of drawing the lines within the States
- States draw federal rep lines (not Senate because obviously)
- Gerrymandering
    - Named for Gov. Eldridge Gerry
    - Lines drawn for partisan purposes (gross)
    - Everyone does this, **all of the time.** (they're kinda gross)
- Packing and Cracking
    - Packing: putting as many of one party as possible in just one district
    - Cracking: putting just few enough of one party as possible to that they aren't majority
-
