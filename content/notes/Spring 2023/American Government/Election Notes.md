## A *Republican* Form of Government

- Not party-related, literal definition
- We get to choose *who's in charge*

## Legislative Elections

- We elect House Reps every 2 years

## The Parties are Dying! (fricking finally)

- TV's popularity helped
- The Internet helped even more

## Well parties aren't that bad in concept...

- Simply an organizational structure
- Parties communicate their *platform* (values/stances)
- The platform is where things go sour (extreme partisanship)
- Parties are *supposed to be* closer to the middle and not as radical

## Parties still suck.

- Washington's Farewell Address predicted the future perfectly
