## Israel's Call

- Models Isaiah's Call
	1. God is Israel's Living King (6:1)
	2. Highest of All (6:2-3)
	3. Israel is unholy compared to God (6:4-5)
	4. God purifies Isaiah with Fire (6:6-7)
		- Scriptural theme of Fire (sometimes leading fire like in the wilderness, sometimes cleansing/destructive fire like Sodom/Gomorrah)

## The Syria-Ephraim War (725 BC)

- Ephraim = Samaria = "Israel" = Northern Israel
- Syria and Israel ally against Assyria
- They try to force Ahaz of Judah into coalition
- Isaiah tells Ahaz to ally with God, and they will be protected from all 3 (but actually 5) foes
- Instead, Ahaz tries to outlast a siege
- Isaiah prophesies the fall of Syria and Ephraim
- Confirmed by 3 signs of male children
	- Immanuel (7:4-17) - God with (or against) us
	- Maher-shalal-hashbaz (8:3-8, 10) - "To the spoils!"
	- Messiah (9:6-7) - Royal and qualities of divinity
- Isaiah encouraged confidence in God
- Ahaz aligns himself (as the vassal) with Assyria
- Syria and Ephraim fall, then Judah
- Remnant of Jacob (Ephraim) will return (10:20-23)
- Judah under Assyrian yoke temporarily (10:24-27)
- The "Righteous Branch" will usher forth a second exodus (11:1-11, 15-16; 14:1)
- The fall of "Lucifer", King of Babylon (14:3-4, 12-22)
	- Williamson reads this from a metaphorical stance, saying the Babylonian King is full of hubris and falls
- Anticipation of Resurrection
