## Q1: The Prophets & Their Day: 

##### Your friend sends you a YouTube video about how prophets in the OT only predicted the distant future. You decide to make your own video explaining how OT prophets also had a message for their own audiences in their own day. Write a brief script for your video. Be sure to include the multiple purposes of OT prophets/prophecy. Also compare and contrast the specific purposes of Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah in their own day. Finally, tell your audience which of these three prophets you want to be more like and why. 

### Prompts to help direct your answer: 

1. Who were prophets, how did they become prophets, and what did they do/say?
2. What was going on economically, politically, and religiously in the 8<sup>th</sup> century that called for Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah to prophesy? 
3. What did Amos have to say to 8<sup>th</sup> century Israel? 
4. What did Hosea have to say to 8<sup>th</sup> century Israel? 
5. What did Isaiah have to say to 8<sup>th</sup> century Israel? 
6. What are the differences between Amos & Hosea? 
7. Which would you like to be more like and why? 

**My Answer: The prophets of the Old Testament became prophets in various different ways. Amos, for example, was a shepherd from the Southern nation of Judah, but after receiving a vision specifically targeted towards the Northern nation of Israel, he decided to become a prophet. Hosea received a direct, vocal request from God to marry a prostitute and continually retrieve her in her infidelity. This was meant to be a direct metaphor for Israel's disobedience and God's loyalty to his people. Isaiah was likely born of a royal family, and was called by God to prophesy, despite his lack of schooling in prophecy. All three of these prophets had very important messages for their day, and I don't understand why people think that they're message is more important today than it was back then. This is such an inane take that I don't even know where to start debunking it. Most of their prophecies directly referenced and discussed issues of Israel's impending demise, it can't get any more clear that these prophets were not just predicting the distant future. Amos directly stated that the land would be consumed and destroyed by using descriptions of fire and locusts. Hosea illustrated Israel's behavior by comparing it to the prostitute that God asked him to marry. Isaiah directly told the powers of the land that alliances will bring them nowhere. If I had to pick one of these prophets to try and emulate today, I would like to be like Amos as he was an effective speaker who traveled to people who he knew needed his message.**

## Q2: Justice & Mercy:

##### Your church is divided on the issue of whether the God of the OT is a just God or a merciful God. Describe to them how God demonstrated justice against the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. Then, describe how God demonstrated mercy toward the enemies of Israel in the books of Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah. End with a couple of suggestions on how human can demonstrate both God's justice AND mercy to their enemies today. 

### Prompts to help direct your answer: 

1. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Jonah? 
2. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Nahum? 
3. What do we learn about divine justice and mercy from Obadiah? 
4. Why it is important for God to be both just and merciful? How does he do it? 
5. Why is it important for us to be both just and merciful? How do we do it? 

**My Answer: I think that as a church we shouldn't be asking about whether God is merciful or just. The Bible makes it excruciatingly clear that God is both. In Jonah God's mercy is on full display as he spares Nineveh. However, in Nahum God shows his justice by ending Nineveh after they waste their second chance. In addition, in Obadiah, God's justice and mercy are both shown through a warning to Edom. God shows that he will punish them if they don't change, but will also give them a chance to change before he punishes. It is very important for God to be both just and merciful because God is love. A loving God helps his subjects to change in ways that benefit them and those around them, and this can be either through just punishment or through merciful admonishment. We as Christians need to be the same towards others, but we need to act as peers, not as "rulers" over "subjects". God is merciful and just through his correction towards people. To be just and merciful towards others we must also correct people, but in a loving way as God does.**

## Q3: The Messiah and Day of the Lord: 

##### Pretend a modern day evangelist gets on TV and says the world is going to end in 2030 based on his understanding of "The Day of the Lord" and "The Coming of the Messiah" in the OT prophets. You have a chance to write a brief response that will be read by the same audience. Explain how "the Day of the Lord" was understood by Israel prior to the prophets. Then, explain how the OT Prophets alter the expectations of that day. Finally, explain how Jesus's second coming will be similar to the OT Day of the Lord and how it will be different. 

### Prompts to help direct your answer: 

1. What was the average Israelite expecting would happen on the Day of the Lord? 
2. What did the prophets teach that corrected this misunderstanding? W  at's the significance of these changes? 
3. What type of messiah was Israel expecting? How do Micah's and Isaiah's prophecies about the coming messiah fit with Jesus's first coming? How about his second coming?

**Before the prophets, the Day of the Lord was viewed in a way that heavily favored the Israelites. It was thought that something physical and/or geopolitical would happen in the world to signify the day. In addition, they thought Israel would be restored. Because they thought that they were the center of the world, Israelites thought that all Gentiles would be destroyed on the Day of the Lord. However, all of these things were entirely wrong, and the prophets informed the people that almost the exact opposite would happen. Israel would not be restored, but made equal in nearly every way to the Gentiles in the eyes of the Lord. In addition, the Gentiles and Jews alike would be lifted up if they followed the one God would send (later revealed to be Jesus). It was also said that there would be no escape for anyone, Jew or Gentile alike, when the Day of the Lord comes. Every person on Earth would face judgement on that day. Jesus' return will be similar top the OT view in that it is a very important day, but it will not be anywhere near as Israel-centric as they thought it would be.
