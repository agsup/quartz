## Faithfulness: A study in Hosea

### Chapters 4-5

- "Divorce Proceedings"
	- *Reev*: Covenant Lawsuit
- Reason for Divorce: No relational knowledge
	- No one wants to be with God (they swear, lie, murder, steal, etc.)
	- Because of this God separates Himself from them
	- "This staff will be my oracle"
- Verdict: God withdraws, Assyria invades Israel
- Raising a battle cry in Beth Aven
	- Beth*el* is the house of God
	- Beth *Aven* is the house of *nothingness* or *wickedness*

### Chapters 6-7

- "Half-baked repentance"
	- Very "Orthodox" repentance
	- They don't repent from the heart
	- "Sorry (not sorry)"
	- Israel is trying to manipulate or take advantage of God's forgiveness, which they will live to regret
	- Israel is trying to treat God like a vending machine
- Israel's love is fleeting
	- Like the dew, heated oven, unturned loaf, senseless dove, faulty bow, etc.
- God desires *Hesed*, not sacrifices
	- *Hesed*: Covenant love

## God Will Restore Israel

- He will *heal* them once His anger has turned from them
- The people of Israel will have to act in a way that pleases God
	- Example: Addiction
		- Addiction is not usually broken through words, but through action. Same with Israel

## Identify an Illustration of Your Love for God

> I love God as one loves nature. When noticed, He is wonderful, but I can be guilty of overlooking Him.

## Exercise:

### 1. List characteristics of God. Think about your own characteristics. (3 of each)

- God
	1. Desires exclusivity
	2. Wants to aid his followers
	3. Beautiful/excellent
- Myself
	1. Desires exclusivity
	2. Open-minded
	3. In need

### 2. Journal about unforgiven transgressions, and what would remedy them.

> Lately I have transgressed against myself and against my family by being careless in many areas. I do not know the root cause of this carelessness, but it is a vice that I have struggled with for a long time. I would like your help with remedying this in any way you can, and I am willing to try many things to fix it.
