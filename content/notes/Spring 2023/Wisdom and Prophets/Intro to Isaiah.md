## Isaiah the Man

- Husband and Father (7:3, 8:3, 18)
- Resident of Jerusalem (7:3)
- Royal Family?
	- Father was likely Amoz, brother of King Amaziah of Judah (1:1)
- Called to Prophesy (not schooled in the ways of prophecy) (Ch. 6)
- Sawed in two under Manasseh in 687-642 BCE

## Isaiah, the Navi Bulla

- Bulla (seal) found for Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, King of Judah
- Another Bulla found for Isaiah, \[Hey-\]Nun-Bet-Yod\[-aleph?\]
- These were found in the same archaeological layer
- This says three things
	1. This "Isaiah" is important
	2. Missing space can be filled to spell "Prophet"
	3. TODO: rewatch and fill in point 3

	- Politics is futile, God is Israel's safety!
