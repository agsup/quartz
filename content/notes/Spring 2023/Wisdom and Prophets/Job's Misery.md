## Job's Friends

### Eliphaz: God Follows Retribution
- Retribution revealed by the natural order and the divine
- Human should respond with repentance/appreciation
- Divine should restore the repentant

### Bildad: God is Just

- Does God prevent justice?
- Job's children got what they deserved
- God restores the repentant
- Job's Response: God is arbiter, so God is arbitrary
    - "The wicked prosper"

### Zophar: God is fair

- Your sins deserve worse punishment
- God restores the repentant
- Job's Response: Covenant Lawsuit (*Reev*) with God
    - *Lex Talionis*: The punishment should fit the crime

## Jobs Crosses the Line

- Job hasn't threatened to give up his faith
- Moves from doubt to pride, which is where he sins
    - Puts God in the wrong
    - Calls for a self-curse
    - Righteous in his own eyes
    - Justifies himself rather than God

## Elihu

### Elihu Prepares Job for God

- Waited for the older ("wiser") men to finish
- Storm theophany and rhetorical questions
- Directs Job to the created order, and shows that the order is good
- It is likely that Elihu is more right than any of the other friends
- He burns with anger not just at the friends, but also at Job for turning his doubt to pride

### Elihu's Speech

- Job has sinned
- Good isn't always rewarded and sin's punishment isn't divine revenge
- God delayed for you to seek a relationship with him and not relief only
- Elihu is defending God himself

## God and Job

### God's Speech

- The whirlwind represents how wild and untameable God is
    - Describes Behemoth and Leviathan
    - God can control the uncontrollable
- The cosmic order is not mechanical or predictable, and is not subject to human understanding/control

### Job's Response

- Repentance, God vindicates him
    - "I am unworthy!"

## The Verdict

    - Can't simplify God
    - No *quid pro quo* religion
- God commends Job's honest words
    - Job refused to let repentance become a manipulative tools
    - Refused to admit wrong-doing
    - Courageously questioned and dissected his way to real faith, rather than inheriting his friends' faith
