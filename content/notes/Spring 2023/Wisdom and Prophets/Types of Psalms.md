## Penitential Laments

### Structure

1. Address to God
2. Complaint
3. Request
4. Expression of Faith

### Takeaways

- These types of Psalms are about not accepting "cheap grace"
- It is an acknowledgement of sin, and an acceptance of responsibility
	- You cannot forgive your own sins, this <u>must</u> be taken up to God
- Trying to regain God's favor and do his work
- God's grace is not "cheap", but it is still given plentifully

## Imprecatory Psalms

- Psalms that ask God to bring curses upon enemies
- Goals include:
	- Cursing Individuals
	- Cursing Nations
	- Divine Judgement
	- Religious persecution
	- Liberation for God's Name's Sake
	- etc.

### Takeaways

- It is a request to God to destroy enemies, rather than taking matters into one's own hands
- Often asks specifically for retribution
- The rationale for destruction of enemies is often that the Psalmist is suffering for God
- Suggestions for judgement are proposed by the Psalmist
	- "...may his days be few; may another take his office!"
	- This excerpt is later applied to Judas
- Forgiveness?
	- Embrace forgiveness (Matthew 5)
	- Your role vs God's role
- Christians should forgive, but sometimes one must pursue justice
- If Divine Judgement is requested, it must be for God's honor, not yours
- The Judgement many or may not come in your lifetime
- Do not gloat in the Judgement of those you have requested Judgement upon
- Remember that all will be judged in the end
