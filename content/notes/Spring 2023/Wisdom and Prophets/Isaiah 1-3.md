## Israel's Estranged Herself from God

- Israel is under divine judgement (Ahab's House)
- 3 Sins:
	1. Forsaken God
	2. Hypocritical worship
	3. Corrupt society
- Israel does not "know" God (1:3-9, 5:13, 1:21)
	- They know how to "worship" God, but they do not actually know Him
	- Providence did not lead to gratitude
	- Forsaken the *Holy One of Israel* (this phrase is used 25 times)
		- Shows that God is distinct, different from the other "gods"
	- Utterly estranged, beyond remedy
	- Nearly extinct as a nation

## God Seeks After the Estranged

- God seeks sincere worship and sincere lives (1:10-17, 29)
	- God rejects manipulative and syncretistic worship
	- God seeks transformed lives and worship
- God will purify Israel by exile (1:18-29, 25-26, 31)
- Gentiles will flow into Israel (2:1-5)
