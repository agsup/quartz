## Intro

- An experienced prophet (2 Kings 14:25)
- Probably a real person
- From Gath-Hepher

## The Storm at Sea (Ch. 1)

- Typical prophetic call, atypical response
- Cry out against implies a possibility of repentance (Jonah probably knows this)
- Three times "down" to Joppa/into the boat/into the sea
- God sends his word, a storm, a fish, a plant, a worm, and an east wind
- The Pagan mariners are more faithful than Jonah

## Jonah's Lament Psalm (Ch. 2)

- The Lord "prepared" a large fish to save Jonah
- Details parallel those of Jesus' resurrection (Matt 12:40)
	- 3 days
	- Separated from God's presence
	- God delivered both from a "grave" of different kinds
- Jonah promised to repay vows, he repents
- Vomited out into new life

## Jonah Prophesies in Nineveh (Ch. 3)

- Same prophetic call, different response
- Nineveh is the Capital of Assyria
- 3 day walk through the city
- Preached (Hebrew) words of condemnation on a *1 day walk*
	- Is this what God commanded him to say or are these his words?
- All of Nineveh **repents**, hoping that YHWH will **relent** (he did)

## Jonah Makes God Choose (Ch. 4)

- Atypical prophet (opposes target audience and God, awaits their destruction)
- Abhors God's nature (Exodus 34:6-7), especially his mercy
- Assyria's atrocities *were now void*
	- Jonah wanted to be valid in his hatred, but now cannot
- Jonah wants to be the dictator of life/death
- YHWH's Parable of the Plant
	- Jonah cares more about plant than people

## Jonah Ends With A Question

*[[To whom does the power of salvation belong?]]*
