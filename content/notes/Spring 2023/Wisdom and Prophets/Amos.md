## Bethel and Gilgal

- Wives of the Israelites called "Cows of Bashan"
	- Pampered and prized
	- They oppress the poor through indifference/demanding more wealth
- Prophecy of the Assyrian exile with fishhooks
- Note: Inaction is oppression.
- Amos mocks the mocker
	- Their worship is sin (should be in Judah, not Bethel/Gilgal)
	- Their sacrifice = ineffective

## God's Last Resort (Ch. 4)

- Discipline of various kinds:
	- Famine
	- Drought
	- Pestilence
	- War
	- Fire
- "Prepare to meet your God"

## Do Not Seek The Altars (Ch. 5)

- "The altar" (literal and metaphorical) alone will not save you
	- Church and chapel are examples of metaphorical altars
- Seek Social Justice: Right your Wrongs

## Amos' Visions (Ch. 7-8)

- Locusts
	- LORD formed locusts that ate everything
	- Amos intervenes, and the LORD relents
- Fire Shower
	- Fire was made to consume the land
	- Amos intervenes, and the LORD relents
- Plumb Line
	- A built wall with a plumb line built into it
	- LORD says that the wall will be completely torn down
	- Jeroboam will be brought down by the sword
	- He will pass by Israel for a time
- Summer Fruit/End
	- "Fruit" and "End" sound alike in Hebrew
	- Usage is intentional, Hebrew wordplay
	- The fruit is ripe, the time has come, the end is near

## Injustice

- The poor are being mistreated
- False measures in the marketplace
- Expansion of points from [Ch. 2](#God%20of%20the%20Nations)
- Worst kind of deceiver is the one who deceives their own
- Because of this...
	- Famine of the Prophetic Word
		- God will withhold prophets from Israel during/preceding the Assyrian exile
	- No escape from the Day of the Lord
	- God points out that he has many "exodus people"
		- Many of the other nations have been saved in the same way as Israel
	- Being one of God's "exodus peoples" will not prevent judgement

## Bonus Chapter (Ch. 9)

- Good news
- Israel will be rebuilt
	- Independence
	- Davidic King
		- Unbeknownst to Amos, this is a reference to Jesus
	- Abundant Produce
	- Repossession of the Land
