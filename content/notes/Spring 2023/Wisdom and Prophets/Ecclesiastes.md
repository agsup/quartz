## Theme: *Carpe Diem*

**Question: "Is there meaning in life?"**

Hevel: Meaningless

## General Viewpoint of the Author

- They were a king
- They gather that everything is meaningless (Eccl. 1)
- Life is vain
- The afterlife is uncertain (no one's been there and come back)
- "All go to dust, and to dust all return."

## Qoheleth (EkklÄ“siastou): "the gatherer of the assembly"

- Qoheleth guides the assembly to reflect on life's big questions
- Focus is "under the sun" (of the world)
- This character is inspired by Solomon (but probably not written by Solomon)

### Who is Qoheleth?

- The language and style of Eccl is "Late Biblical Hebrew" (post-Exile)
- Likely written ~500 years after Solomon
- Attributed to Solomon because he was wise and worldly

## The Big Question

- Is the world filled with meaning?
	- Different from whether you can *find* meaning in the world
	- Does your individual life have a purpose

## The meaning of *Hevel*

- *PRO* (Three ways of reading *Hevel*)
	- **P**: Pessimist (life is empty, vain, meaningless, etc., but God is filling)
	- **R**: Realist (life is absurd, paradoxical, etc., but God is not)
	- **O**: Optimist (life is short, fleeting, etc., but enjoyable for one who lives for God)
	- Williamson suggests the *optimist* view

## *Carpe Diem*

- Wisdom is fleeting, so...
	- Stop searching for it endlessly
	- Use it to help people
	- Use it to solve problems
- Fun/Pleasure is fleeting, so...
	- Enjoy a good meal
	- Enjoy people
- Work is fleeting, so...
	- Enjoy your work
- Wealth is fleeting, so...
	- Enjoy spending it
	- Help others with it
- Cautionary tale for the youth...
	-  Enjoy youth before the "evil days" (age)
- God is the foundation (*creator*) and goal (*end of the matter*) of life
- Enjoying life is in itself an act of "remembering" God

### Stop Chasing the Wind

- Enjoy the present
- Stop and smell the roses
- YOLO
- Slow down
- The grass is greener on the other side
- The story of the magic spool of yarn (time)

## Answering The Big Question

- Life is short so...
	- I should chase after more of it, regret what I never did, got out and live for today
