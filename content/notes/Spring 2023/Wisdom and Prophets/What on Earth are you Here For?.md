1. Mission before college
	- I often gave technological help to the church in any way that I could. I once worked on a need request form that use some Google plugins to automatically mail people capable of doing the task at hand.
2. Mission during college
	- I'm honestly not sure yet. Service projects through DXD have really helped direct this, but I hope to do more than that.
3. Mission after college
	- Again, uncertain. I hope this will become clear to me through prayer.
