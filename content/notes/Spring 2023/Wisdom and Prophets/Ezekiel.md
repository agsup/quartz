## Main Themes

1. Don't be complacent, the exile is *your fault*
	- Sugar/Cavity Proverb
		- *The fathers have eaten sour grapes and your children's teeth got set on edge*
		- The fathers ate badly, but the children got cavities
	- Covenanted with nations and idolatry with other gods
	- False reassuring prophets, absent shepherds and stubborn people
2. Exile will be longer and worse than you think
	- 70 years full of war, deportations, and the destruction of the Temple
3. Restoration will follow for a remnant with a new covenant heart, spirit, and temple
	-  YHWH is with the exiles, the dead bones rise from the dead

## What to Expect

- Strange images, visions, and actions
- Some Rabbis forbade those under 30 from reading Ezekiel
- Unreceptive audience needs "shock"
- Very little about Ezekiel himself

## World Context

- Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon fight over Palestine
	- Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah under rule of Assyria
	- Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC
	- Josiah enact religions reforms in 622 BC (Ezekiel born)
	- Babylon rising in power in the 7<sup>th</sup> century BC
	- Egypt (Pharaoh Necho) allied with Assyria against Babylon
	- Josiah (of Judah) tried to stop Egypt from aiding Assyria and died at the battle of Megiddo
	- Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin into Babylonian exile along with Ezekiel in 597 BC

## Theological Concerns

1. Who is the remnant? Babylonian exiles or Palestinian survivors
	- Whichever is more faithful to God
2. Whose God is stronger? Babylon's or Israel's?
	- God's ability to act through curses shows his power
	- Because he actually punishes us, he is real
3. YHWH is omnipresent
4. YHWH is holy
