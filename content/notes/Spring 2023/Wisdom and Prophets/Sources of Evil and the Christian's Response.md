# Why Is All of This Happening? Sources of Evil and the Christian's Response
## Who is Responsible for Evil?

- *Rāh* in Hebrew is "hardship", "trouble", or "disaster"
- God brings about both good and *rāh* (trouble)

## Where does evil come from?

- Materialists blame natural causes
- Atheists say Christians can only blame God
- Some Christians say evil doesn't exist
- Some Christians are *overly* interested in evil

## Complex Problem: 5 Answers

### 1. Ourselves

- We are tempted by our own desire (James 1:13-15)
- We are the ones who sin (Joshua 7:20)
- More examples: Uzzah, Nadau, Ananias, Mirian, and Barabbas

### 2. Other Humans

- Humans can be malicious towards other humans (Daniel 3:8-12)
- Story of Stephen (Acts 7:54-58)

### 3. Demon(s)

- Satan has angels (Rev. 12:9, 12)
- Satan himself "prowls around" (1 Peter 5:8)
- The Bible speaks of cosmic powers and spiritual forces (Eph 6:12)
- Paul warns about sacrificing to demons (1 Cor. 10:19-20)

### 4. God

- God can bring down curses (Amos 4:9)
- God brings judgement (1 Cor. 11:19-30)
	- Examples: fire, serpents, other nations, etc.
- Not necessarily a source of "evil" but of "judgement" that from a human perspective seems unfair

### 5. Accidents

- Abraham just died (Gen 25:8)
- Storms come (Matt 8:23)
- Disease/injury just happens (Mark 5:25)
- Accidents just happen (Deut 19:5)

## Responding to Evil

- Discerning the source is difficult
- Knowing that there are different sources keeps one grounded
	- Keeps blame from God
	- Restricts power to Satan
	- Encourages taking responsibility for one's sins
	- Encourages an attitude of grace
