## Question: How do you govern the (massive) US population?

## America's Founding Documents
- ### Big Four:
	1. Declaration of Independence (1776)
		- Unalienable Rights (Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness) 
		- These rights come from God, not kings
		- Rights are secured by Government
		- Government power is derived from the governed
		- Governed are allowed to overthrow a sour government for their own safety and happiness
		- States declared as independent and free (each of them individually)
		- #### About Jefferson...
			- Believed his writing as a young man, turned super immoral later in life though
	2. Articles of Confederation (1777)
		- Strong central government = king = bad
		- This solution was too weak
	3. Constitution (1787, 7 articles)
		- States become United
		- Everyone is equal
			- Or, "everyone" (men) is "equal" (if you're the right race lol)
		- Unity = power
		- Government is created and powered by the people
		- Each state has its own constitution
		- Each city has its own government
		- All leaders in every government in the US are elected
	4. Bill of Rights (1789)
