## Popular Love Songs

1. 
> I'll search the sky  
> I'll jump the moon  
> Until I find someone like you

2. The lyrics reveal that the most important things in a loving relationship is commitment and desire.
3. These lyrics could definitely be used to describe God's love for a person and vice versa.

## Song of Solomon

1. 
> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
> your neck with strings of jewels. 
> We will make you earrings of gold,
> studded with silver.

2. With common modern views in popular love songs today, the most important things are beauty and gifts.
3. I don't think that this is an accurate reflection of God's love.

## Conclusion

1. Popular love songs cherish the other end of the relationship similarly to how Solomon does
2. The difference is that popular modern love songs focus more on appearance and (surprisingly) posession without focusing as much on internal beauty.
