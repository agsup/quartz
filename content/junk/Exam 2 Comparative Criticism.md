# Explanation

I think that John told the story the way he did to be concise and detailed. The concision of the story is clear when in comparison to the accounts in Matthew and Mark (5 verses as opposed to 11 in Matthew and 7 in Mark), though it is especially apparent when seeing what details John decides to leave out, the main ones being that he does not include details about what the apostles felt aside from the fact that they were "terrified", and he does not include Jesus starting his statement with "take courage", likely because the statement already ends with "don't be afraid". John shows his attention to detail in this story by stating that they were heading to Capernaum, whereas Mark states that they are headed to Bethsaida. Upon analyzing multiple maps of the area (one being https://bibleatlas.org/full/bethsaida.htm), I can discern that Capernaum is a port city and Bethsaida is landlocked. Given this information, it is likely that John states that the apostles are to get "into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum" so that they can continue on land from there to Bethsaida; Mark is not focused on this specific detail, and Matthew leaves out the destination entirely. In addition, John is the only one to state the distance required to travel to their destination, which emphasizes the miraculous nature of the boat reaching the shore immediately after Jesus boards. I think the reason that John chooses this approach is twofold. Firstly, he aims to properly emphasize the miraculous nature of the immediate arrival at the destination with his attention to detail and accuracy. Secondly, John wants and to appeal to his Jewish audience, who consider terseness a virtue.
