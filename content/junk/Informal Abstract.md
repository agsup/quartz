3D printers have advanced significantly in the past 13 years. After the patent from Stratasys expired, the open source community has taken charge in making 3D printing more affordable, more capable, and more user-friendly. This paper will start by   modern 3D printing's humble roots in the RepRap project, Marlin 1.0, and the utilization of hobby-level 8 bit micro-controllers. Then we will transition into the advent of Marlin 2.0 and 32 bit ARM micro-controllers, and will go into the modern era, with the Klipper firmware at the cutting edge of progress in the field. Furthermore, this paper will delve into the implementation details of each of these eras, progressing from simple C++ core-based single-board firmware, to a comprehensive, configurable Linux web server solution.
