# Inspired Soul-Care: The Connections Between Spirituality and Mental Health

## Pre-Seminar

## Section 1: Exploring the Connections Between Spirituality and Mental Health (Panel)

### Overview

- Darden's observed trends in Gen Z
	- Need more resilience?
		- "Mr. Darden you're wrong! Do you know what we've gone through?" - Student
		- Studies show that Gen Z is least likely to self-report very good/excellent mental health (45% compared to 51% in second last)
		- Gen Z is also more likely to stress about:
			- Mass shootings
			- Rise in suicide rates
			- Climate change
			- Separation/deportation of immigrant families
			- Widespread sexual harassment/assault reports
			- etc.
	- Gen Z is a more *global* generation
		- More involved in the Internet
		- Social media
		- More demanding
			- This is mostly a good thing, especially with activism
		- Put weight on meaningful experiences to their lives
- What is the *soul*?
	- What does Scripture say?
		- 1 Thess. 5:23
			- Three elements (Spirit, Soul, Body)
			- Trinitarian in nature, mirrors the tri-union of God
		- Matthew 10:28
			- Distinction between the body and soul
			- Soul is more vital than the body
		- Hebrews 4:12
			- The word of God has the power to pierce soul, spirit, and body
		- Mark 12:30-31
			- Love God with your Heart/Soul/Mind/Strength
	- Without loving yourself, you can't adequately love others
	- Hebrew word for *soul* is *nephesh* (Job 12:7-10)
	- First used when talking about animals in Genesis, also describes humans
		- Darden's Take: Animals have souls
	- Greek word for *soul* is *psyche* (*psychology* is the study of the soul)
	- Darden's Definition: ***The Principle of Life, Thought, Feeling, and Action in human beings.***
		- Youngblood's Input: The soul is a more *personal* thing than a "principle", per se.
- From *Spirituality in Healthcare*:
	- *Shalom*, which often translates as *Peace*, was intended to be a broad definition for health, *physical and spiritual*
	- Physical sickness was seen as a spiritual imbalance
- The Great Divide:
	- Spiritual Illness and Physical Illness are sequestered to their own corners of health
		- For Spiritual you go to a church official, for Physical you go to a medical professional
	- Mental Illness: brain-based conditions that affect thinking, emotions and behaviors (they are so common as to be part of the human experience)
- From *ACT for Clergy and Pastoral Counselors*:
	- For many patients, spiritual care is a major source of strength while dealing with a physical illness
	- Conversely, physical illness can be a catalyst for spiritual struggle
	- Questions such as, "Is life fair? Does God care? What did I do to deserve this?" surface
	- Common denominator among humans: we die, and we suffer. What we do with it is up to us
- Bio-Psycho-Social-Spiritual Model of Wellness
	- All of these areas overlap, and they are all important
	- Coping mechanisms are sought after when there is an *imbalance* in one of these areas
- Alameda County Study (1965)
	- Tracked health behaviors
	- Churchgoers reportedly had better mental health outcomes than the general population
- Spirituality vs. Religion
	- Spirituality is determining what is meaningful in life (personal journey)
	- Religion is focusing on a God (Spirituality can be gained from this, but it is still a separate entity)
- Linkages
	- Mental Health deals with thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
	- Religion seeks to answer how people should life
	- Spirituality seeks to answer questions about meaning
	- They collectively answer 3 questions:
		- How should I *think*?
		- How should I *feel*?
		- How should I *act*?

## Section 2: What is the Soul, and How do we Take Care of It?

- Soul/Essence are similar, but different
- 3 parts of a person
	- Body, Soul/Spirit, Mind
- Physical/Emotional/Mental are components to our essence, but Spirituality encompasses the whole essence, connecting the whole
- The essence is the connection between the three parts of a person
- The field of Psychology is very *humanistic*
	- We decided that man needed to be more "scientific", that things need to be concrete
	- Anything outside of that is "superstitious", which was deemed as a negative
	- Separation of the *physical* from the *psychological*
- We should aim to **integrate** the physical and spiritual
- We *think* that we are fighting with each other
- "A Christian would never need a counselor! All they need is Jesus!"
	- This is not only stupid, but hurtful. 
	- *It shuts down access to counseling to those who need it!!!*
- Counselors are professional burden bearers
- We are all called to bear each other's burdens
- Phil. 4:4-9
	- Pray and petition, but that's only step 1
- Build a filter about what you intake
	- Step 0: is it *true* (not "does it '*feel*' true")?
- Saying "stop worrying about it" is one of the most unhelpful things you can say
	- "Shame based counseling" doesn't work!
- Trauma impacts our brains' pathways
	- This is why we should *not* shame others for how they handle mental health, they might have the mental circuitry to handle it *beaten out* of them
- We are supposed to take care of ourselves, but we cannot do that *by* ourselves
- The statement "you can't change others, only yourself" is ***false.***
	- You are just like others, so if you can't change them, what makes you think you can change yourself?
- You can put *yourself* in a position to be changed (this is called **humility**), *and* you can influence others
- *Solitude* and *Isolation* are different
	- Solitude is voluntary, and hopefully productive for the spirit
	- Isolation is voluntary, but because it pushes others away
	- Think isolation = "holding in", solitude = "letting out"
- We need to take in our experiences and ***process them***, and link with others about those experiences.
- Isolation = "emotional constipation"
- Emotions *do not have inherent moral value*. They are simply *facts of life*
- How you "feel" is not adequately answered with a state of being such as "hungry" or "tired", but with an emotion (sad, mad, glad, scared, etc.)
- We pretend that there are no burdens to bear
- Talking with people who will listen and help you process emotion is important
	- People who try to invalidate your emotion are unhelpful ("you shouldn't be mad because...")

## Section 3: Body and Soul (Hamilton Archibald)

- Theological basis: Who are you?
	- Soul Care: the manner in which you take care of your soul (duh)
	- There are many things included with the idea of soul care
		- It's like taking care of a house, could mean cleaning, organizing, renovating, etc.
	- The individual is both the physical *and* spiritual entity
	- Heb 4:12
		- Sharp enough to separate soul/spirit, joints/marrow, and separates thoughts/attitudes of the heart
		- Soul and spirit are very similar, but the sharpness is enough to separate even this finely
	- Give yourself the same care you would give someone else
	- To help others, it is important to take care of/protect your own spirit
	- Physical and Spiritual are very intertwined
		- ex. sexual immorality is a matter of the body, but affects the soul
	- Keep blameless your body, soul, and spirit
	- Each of these three things are autonomous, but interconnected
- Three parts of soul care
	- Physical action
		- The use of your body to fulfill the will of God
	- Emotional Rational
		- We run into emotional distress when we ask, "what's the point? what makes me important?"
	- Eternal Focus
		- Heaven, the afterlife, etc.
	- It feels good to be 
		- Accepted
		- Validated
		- In great shape
	- Ways to improve spiritual health
		- Remove stress
		- Enjoy your current state
		- Work he direction of a deeply desired outcome
	- These help you move from the *past* into the *present* with preparation for the *future*
- Context is more important than content
	- Ex. Food
		- Not enough food could give an opportunity to lost fat, where too much food could give opportunity to gain muscle
- Remove *toxins* from your mind
	- ex. inner monologue of self-doubt
- Take small steps towards improving your health, progress doesn't happen overnight
- Being more productive/healthy with the body can help with productivity/health of the mind
	- *Moving helps your mentality*
	- Cardio is especially good
- Taking care of the body is not just an exercise in vanity, it is *taking care of one of the three parts of the soul*
